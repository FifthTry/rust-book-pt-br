You can optionally specify a <em>loop label</em> on a loop that we can then use with <code>break</code> or <code>continue</code> to specify that those keywords apply to the labeled loop instead of the innermost loop. Here’s an example with two nested loops:</div>

While the
condition is true, the loop runs. When the condition ceases to be true, the
program calls <code>break</code>, stopping the loop. It’s possible to implement behavior
like this using a combination of <code>loop</code>, <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, and <code>break</code>; you could
try that now in a program, if you’d like. However, this pattern is so common
that Rust has a built-in language construct for it, called a <code>while</code> loop. In
Listing 3-3, we use <code>while</code> to loop the program three times, counting down each
time, and then, after the loop, print a message and exit.</p>

For example, if you changed the definition of the <code>a</code> array to have four elements but forgot to update the condition to <code>while index &lt; 4</code>, the code would panic. It’s also slow, because the compiler adds runtime code to perform the conditional check of whether the index is within the bounds of the array on every iteration through the loop.</div>

Even in situations in which you want to run some code a certain number of times, as in the countdown example that used a <code>while</code> loop in Listing 3-3, most Rustaceans would use a <code>for</code> loop. The way to do that would be to use a <code>Range</code>, provided by the standard library, which generates all numbers in sequence starting from one number and ending before another number.</div>

Enquanto
a condição é verdadeira, o loop é executado. Quando a condição deixa de ser verdadeira,
o programa chama o <code>break</code>, parando o loop. Esse tipo de loop pode ser implementado
usando uma combinação de <code>loop</code>,<code> if</code>, <code>else</code> e<code> break</code>; você poderia tentar isso
agora em um programa, se você quiser.</p>

para isso, chamado de loop <code>while</code>. A Listagem 3-3 usa <code>while</code>: o programa faz o loop
três vezes, a contagem decrescente de cada vez e, depois do ciclo, imprime
outra mensagem e sai.</p>

        fpm-ui.dark-mode behaviour:

        fpm-ui.dark-mode is a boolean, default false, it tells the UI to show
        the UI in dark or light mode. Themes should use this variable to decide
        which mode to show in UI.

        fpm-ui.dark-mode-follow-system, boolean, default true, keeps track if
        we are reading the value of `dark-mode` from system preference, or user
        has overridden the system preference.

        These two variables must not be set by ftd code directly, but they must
        use `$event-click$: message-host enable-dark-mode`, to ignore system
        preference and use dark mode. `$event-click$: message-host
        disable-dark-mode` to ignore system preference and use light mode and
        `$event-click$: message-host follow-system-dark-mode` to ignore user
        preference and start following system preference.

        we use a cookie: `fpm-dark-mode` to store the preference. The cookie can
        have three values:

           cookie missing /          user wants us to honour system preference
               system-light          and currently its light.

           system-dark               follow system and currently its dark.

           light:                    user prefers light

           dark:                     user prefers light

        We use cookie instead of localstorage so in future `fpm-repo` can see
        users preferences up front and renders the HTML on service wide
        following user's preference.
