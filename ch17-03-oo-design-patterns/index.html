The crux of the
pattern is that a value has some internal state, which is represented by a set
of <em>state objects</em>, and the value’s behavior changes based on the internal
state. The state objects share functionality: in Rust, of course, we use
structs and traits rather than objects and inheritance. Each state object is
responsible for its own behavior and for governing when it should change into
another state. The value that holds a state object knows nothing about the
different behavior of the states or when to transition between states.</p>

change, we won’t need to change the code of the value holding the state or the
code that uses the value. We’ll only need to update the code inside one of the
state objects to change its rules or perhaps add more state objects. Let’s look
at an example of the state design pattern and how to use it in Rust.</p>

field as <code>pub</code>. This means we can implement a method later that will control
how the <code>content</code> field’s data is read. The <code>add_text</code> method is pretty
straightforward, so let’s add the implementation in Listing 17-13 to the <code>impl Post</code> block:</p>

want the <code>content</code> method to return an empty string slice because the post is
still in the draft state, as shown on line 7 of Listing 17-11. For now, let’s
implement the <code>content</code> method with the simplest thing that will fulfill this
requirement: always returning an empty string slice. We’ll change this later
once we implement the ability to change a post’s state so it can be published.
So far, posts can only be in the draft state, so the post content should always
be empty. Listing 17-14 shows this placeholder implementation:</p>

Note that rather than having <code>self</code>, <code>&amp;self</code>, or <code>&amp;mut self</code> as the first parameter of the method, we have <code>self: Box&lt;Self&gt;</code>. This syntax means the method is only valid when called on a <code>Box</code> holding the type. This syntax takes ownership of <code>Box&lt;Self&gt;</code>, invalidating the old state so the state value of the <code>Post</code> can transform into a new state.</div>

This is where the <code>Option</code> in the <code>state</code> field of <code>Post</code> comes in: we call the <code>take</code> method to take the <code>Some</code> value out of the <code>state</code> field and leave a <code>None</code> in its place, because Rust doesn’t let us have unpopulated fields in structs. This lets us move the <code>state</code> value out of <code>Post</code> rather than borrowing it. Then we’ll set the post’s <code>state</code> value to the result of this operation.</div>

This ensures <code>Post</code> can’t use the old <code>state</code> value after we’ve transformed it into a new state.</div>

The <code>PendingReview</code> struct also implements the <code>request_review</code> method but doesn’t do any transformations. Rather, it returns itself, because when we request a review on a post already in the <code>PendingReview</code> state, it should stay in the <code>PendingReview</code> state.</div>

pattern to encapsulate the different kinds of behavior a post should have in
each state. The methods on <code>Post</code> know nothing about the various behaviors. The
way we organized the code, we have to look in only one place to know the
different ways a published post can behave: the implementation of the <code>State</code>
trait on the <code>Published</code> struct.</p>

pattern, we might instead use <code>match</code> expressions in the methods on <code>Post</code> or
even in the <code>main</code> code that checks the state of the post and changes behavior
in those places. That would mean we would have to look in several places to
understand all the implications of a post being in the published state! This
would only increase the more states we added: each of those <code>match</code> expressions
would need another arm.</p>

need <code>match</code> expressions, and to add a new state, we would only need to add a

functionality. To see the simplicity of maintaining code that uses the state
pattern, try a few of these suggestions:</p>

<p data-id="0,0,0,1,10,1,0,4:main-container-external:0.inner-external:0,0,0:main" style="border-radius: 0px; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; text-align: left; white-space: initial" class="ft_md"><ul>
<li>Add a <code>reject</code> method that changes the post’s state from <code>PendingReview</code> back
to <code>Draft</code>.</li>
<li>Require two calls to <code>approve</code> before the state can be changed to <code>Published</code>.</li>
<li>Allow users to add text content only when a post is in the <code>Draft</code> state.
Hint: have the state object responsible for what might change about the
content but not responsible for modifying the <code>Post</code>.</li>
</ul>

transitions between states, some of the states are coupled to each other. If we
add another state between <code>PendingReview</code> and <code>Published</code>, such as <code>Scheduled</code>,
we would have to change the code in <code>PendingReview</code> to transition to
<code>Scheduled</code> instead. It would be less work if <code>PendingReview</code> didn’t need to
change with the addition of a new state, but that would mean switching to
another design pattern.</p>

To eliminate some of the
duplication, we might try to make default implementations for the
<code>request_review</code> and <code>approve</code> methods on the <code>State</code> trait that return <code>self</code>;
however, this would violate object safety, because the trait doesn’t know what
the concrete <code>self</code> will be exactly. We want to be able to use <code>State</code> as a
trait object, so we need its methods to be object safe.</p>

and <code>approve</code> methods on <code>Post</code>. Both methods delegate to the implementation of
the same method on the value in the <code>state</code> field of <code>Option</code> and set the new
value of the <code>state</code> field to the result. If we had a lot of methods on <code>Post</code>
that followed this pattern, we might consider defining a macro to eliminate the
repetition (see the <a href="ch19-06-macros.html#macros">“Macros”</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> section in Chapter 19).</p>

languages, we’re not taking as full advantage of Rust’s strengths as we could.
Let’s look at some changes we can make to the <code>blog</code> crate that can make
invalid states and transitions into compile time errors.</p>

Because the only way to get a published <code>Post</code> instance that does have a <code>content</code> method defined is to call the <code>approve</code> method on a <code>PendingReviewPost</code>, and the only way to get a <code>PendingReviewPost</code> is to call the <code>request_review</code> method on a <code>DraftPost</code>, we’ve now encoded the blog post workflow into the type system.</div>
<div data-ext-id="main-container-external:0.inner-external:0,0,0.inner-external:0,0,0,1,10.inner-external:0,0,0,1,10,1,1:main" data-id="0,0,0,1,10,1,1,1,3:main-container-external:0.inner-external:0,0,0.inner-external:0,0,0,1,10.inner-external:0,0,0,1,10,1,1:main" style="border-radius: 0px; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(10,26,31,1); font-family: apple-system; font-size: 15px; font-weight: 400; line-height: 24px; padding-bottom: 8px; text-align: left; white-space: initial" class="ft_md">But we also have to make some small changes to <code>main</code>. The <code>request_review</code> and <code>approve</code> methods return new instances rather than modifying the struct they’re called on, so we need to add more <code>let post =</code> shadowing assignments to save the returned instances. We also can’t have the assertions about the draft and pending review posts’ contents be empty strings, nor do we need them: we can’t compile code that tries to use the content of posts in those states any longer. The updated code in <code>main</code> is shown in Listing 17-21:</div>

However, our gain is that invalid states are now impossible because of the type system and the type checking that happens at compile time! This ensures that certain bugs, such as display of the content of an unpublished post, will be discovered before they make it to production.</div>

These patterns have different trade-offs. Although you might be very familiar with object-oriented patterns, rethinking the problem to take advantage of Rust’s features can provide benefits, such as preventing some bugs at compile time. Object-oriented patterns won’t always be the best solution in Rust due to certain features, like ownership, that object-oriented languages don’t have.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

reading this chapter, you now know that you can use trait objects to get some
object-oriented features in Rust. Dynamic dispatch can give your code some
flexibility in exchange for a bit of runtime performance. You can use this
flexibility to implement object-oriented patterns that can help your code’s
maintainability. Rust also has other features, like ownership, that
object-oriented languages don’t have. An object-oriented pattern won’t always
be the best way to take advantage of Rust’s strengths, but is an available
option.</p>

lots of flexibility. We’ve looked at them briefly throughout the book but

O ponto crucial do padrão
é que um valor tem algun estado interno, que é representado por um conjunto
de <em>objetos de estado</em> e o comportamento do valor é alterado com base no estado
interno. Os objetos de estado compartilham funcionalidade: em Rust, é claro, usamos
estruturas e traits em vez de de objetos e herança. Cada objeto de estado é
responsável por seu próprio comportamento e por administrar quando dev mudar para outro
estado. O valor que contém um objeto de estado não sabe nada sobre o
comportamento diferente dos estados ou quando fazer transição entre os estados.</p>

mudam, não precisamos mudar o código do valor que detém o estado ou o
código que usa o valor. Precisamos apenas atualizar o código dentro de um dos
objetos de estados para mudar suas regras ou talvez adicionar mais objetos de estados. Vamos ver
um exemplo de padrão de projeto de estados e como usá-lo no Rust.</p>

estrutura pública <code>Postagem</code> que contenha algum conteúdo, por isso começaremos com a
definição da estrutura e a função pública <code>new</code> associada para criar uma
instância de <code>Postagem</code>, como mostra a Listageḿ 17-12. Também faremos um trait privado
<code>Estado</code>. Então o <code>Postagem</code> conterá um objeto trait <code>Box&lt;Estado&gt;</code> dentro de um
<code>Option</code> em um campo privado, chamado <code>estado</code>. Você verá porquê o <code>Option</code>
é necessário.</p>

queremos que o método <code>conteudo</code> retorne um pedaço de string vazia, porque a postagem ainda
está no está de rascunho, como mostrado na linha 8 da Listagem 17-11. Por hora, vamos
implementar o método <code>conteudo</code> com a coisa mais simples que atenderá a esse
requisito: sempre retornando um pedaço de string vazia. Mudaremos isso mais tarde,
quando implementaremos a possibilidade de mudar o estado de uma postagem para que ela possa ser publicada.
Até agora, postagens apenas podem estar no estado de rascunho, portanto, o conteúdo da publicação deve estar
vazio. Listagem 17-14 mostra essa implementação substituta:</p>

<div data-ext-id="main-container-external:0.inner-external:0,0,0.inner-external:0,0,0,1,8:fallback" data-id="0,0,0,1,8,1,4:main-container-external:0.inner-external:0,0,0.inner-external:0,0,0,1,8:fallback" style="border-radius: 0px; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(10,26,31,1); font-family: apple-system; font-size: 15px; font-weight: 400; line-height: 24px; padding-bottom: 8px; text-align: left; white-space: initial" class="ft_md">Para consumir o antigo estado, o método <code>solicitar_revisao</code> precisa apropriar-se do valor do estado. Este é o lugar onde o <code>Option</code> no campo <code>estado</code> do <code>Postagem</code>: chamamos o método <code>take</code> para tirar o valor de <code>Some</code> do campo <code>estado</code> e deixar um <code>None</code> no lugar, porque Rust não nos permite ter campos não preenchidos nas estruturas. Isso nos permite mover o valor do <code>estado</code> para fora do <code>Postagem</code> em vez de pedir emprestado. Em seguida, definiremos o valor do <code>estado</code> da postagem como resultado da operação.</div>

Isso garante que o <code>Postagem</code> não pode usar o antigo valor do <code>estado</code> depois de transformá-lo em um novo estado.</div>

A estrutura <code>RevisaoPendente</code> também implementa o método <code>solicitar_revisao</code>, mas não faz nenhuma transformação. Em vez disso, ele retorna a si mesmo, porque quando solicitamos uma revisão em uma publicação já no estado <code>RevisaoPendente</code>, ele deve permanecer no estado <code>RevisaoPendente</code>.</div>

para encapsular os diferentes tipos de comportamentos que um post deve ter em
cada estado. Os métodos do <code>Postagem</code> não sabem nada sobre os vários comportamentos. A
maneira como organizamos o código, nós só temos de procurar num só lugar pra conhecer as
diferentes formas como uma postagem pode comportar-se: a implementação do trait <code>Estado</code>
na estrutura <code>Publicado</code>.</p>

<p data-id="0,0,0,1,10,1,0,1:main-container-external:0.inner-external:0,0,0:fallback" style="border-radius: 0px; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; text-align: left; white-space: initial" class="ft_md"><p>Se fôssemos criar uma implementação alternativa que não usasse o padrão
de estados, poderíamos usar instruções <code>match</code> nos métodos do <code>Postagem</code> ou
mesmo no código <code>main</code>, que verifica o estado da postagem e muda o comportamento
nesses locais. Isso significaria que teríamos que procurar em vários lugares para
entender todas as implicações de uma postagem estar no estado publicado! Isso só
aumentaria o número de estados que adicionamos: cada uma dessas instruções <code>match</code>
precisaria de outra ramificação.</p>

precisam da instrução <code>match</code> e para adicionar um novo estado, apenas precisamos adicionar uma nova estrutura e
implementar os métodos trait nessa estrutura.</p>

funcionalidades. Para ver a simplicidade de manter o código que usa padrão de
estados, tente usar essas sugestões:</p>

<p data-id="0,0,0,1,10,1,0,4:main-container-external:0.inner-external:0,0,0:fallback" style="border-radius: 0px; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; text-align: left; white-space: initial" class="ft_md"><ul>
<li>Adicionar um método <code>reject</code> que altere o estado de postagem de <code>RevisaoPendente</code> de volta
para <code>Rascunho</code>.</li>
<li>Requer duas chamadas para <code>aprovar</code> antes que o estado possa ser alterado para <code>Publicado</code>.</li>
<li>Permitir que os usuários adicinem conteúdo de texto somente quando uma postagem estiver no estado <code>Rascunho</code>.
Dica: Ter o objeto de estado responsável pelo que pode mudar sobre o
conteúdo, mas não responsável por modificar o <code>Postagem</code>.</li>
</ul>

transições entre estados, alguns dos estados estão acoplados uns aos outros. Se adicionarmos
outros estados entre <code>RevisaoPendente</code> e <code>Publicado</code>, como um <code>Scheduled</code>,
teríamos que mudar o código de <code>RevisaoPendente</code> para fazer a transição para
<code>Scheduled</code>. Seria menos trabalhoso se <code>RevisaoPendente</code> não precisasse de
mudanças com a adição de um novo estado, mas isso significaria mudar para
outro padrão de projetos.</p>

Para eleminar parte da
duplicação, podemos tentar fazer a implementação padrão dos métodos
<code>solicitar_revisao</code> e <code>aprovar</code> no trait <code>Estado</code>, que retorna <code>self</code>;
no entanto, isso violaria a segurança dos objetos, porque o trait não sabe
exatamente o que é o <code>self</code> concreto. Queremos que seja possível usar <code>Estado</code> como um
objeto trait, entao precisamos que seus métodos sejam objetos seguros.</p>

<p data-id="0,0,0,1,10,1,0,7:main-container-external:0.inner-external:0,0,0:fallback" style="border-radius: 0px; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; text-align: left; white-space: initial" class="ft_md"><p>Outra duplicação inclui a implementação semelhante dos métodos <code>solicitar_revisao</code>
e <code>aprovar</code> do <code>Postagem</code>. Ambos os métodos delegam a implementação do
mesmo método sobre o valor do campo <code>estado</code> do <code>Option</code> e definem  o novo
valor do campo <code>estado</code> para o resultado. Se tivéssemos muitos métodos no <code>Postagem</code>
que seguissem  esse padrão, poderíamos considerar a definição de uma macro para eliminar
a repetição (veja o Apêndice D, Macros).</p>

não estamos aproveitando ao máximo os pontos fortes do Rust como
poderíamos. Vamos ver algumas mudanças que podemos fazer no o crate <code>blog</code>, que pode tornar
estados e transições inválidas em erros em tempo de compilação.</p>

adicionando outra estrutura, <code>RevisaoPendentePostagem</code>, definindo o método

definindo um método <code>aprovar</code> no <code>RevisaoPendentePostagem</code> para retornar um <code>Postagem</code>, como

Apesar de você poder estar bastante familiarizado com o padrão orientado a objetos, repensar o problema para aproveitar os recursos do Rust pode fornecer benefícios, como evitar alguns bugs em tempo de compilação. Padrões orientados a objetos nem sempre serão a melhor solução em Rust devido certos recursos, como propriedade, que as linguagens orientadas a objetos não têm.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

de ler este capítulo, você agora sabe que pode usar objetos trait para obter alguns
recursos orientado a objetos em Rust. O despacho dinâmico pode dar ao seu código alguma
flexibilidade em troca de um pouco de desempenho em tempo de execução. Você pode usar essa
flexibilidade para implementar padrão orientado a objetos que podem ajudar na manutenção
de seu código. Rust também tem outros recursos, como propriedade, que
linguagens orientadas aobjetos não têm. Um padrão orientado a objetos nem sempre
é a melhor maneira de aproveitar os pontos fortes do Rust, mas é uma opção disponível.</p>

        fpm-ui.dark-mode behaviour:

        fpm-ui.dark-mode is a boolean, default false, it tells the UI to show
        the UI in dark or light mode. Themes should use this variable to decide
        which mode to show in UI.

        fpm-ui.dark-mode-follow-system, boolean, default true, keeps track if
        we are reading the value of `dark-mode` from system preference, or user
        has overridden the system preference.

        These two variables must not be set by ftd code directly, but they must
        use `$event-click$: message-host enable-dark-mode`, to ignore system
        preference and use dark mode. `$event-click$: message-host
        disable-dark-mode` to ignore system preference and use light mode and
        `$event-click$: message-host follow-system-dark-mode` to ignore user
        preference and start following system preference.

        we use a cookie: `fpm-dark-mode` to store the preference. The cookie can
        have three values:

           cookie missing /          user wants us to honour system preference
               system-light          and currently its light.

           system-dark               follow system and currently its dark.

           light:                    user prefers light

           dark:                     user prefers light

        We use cookie instead of localstorage so in future `fpm-repo` can see
        users preferences up front and renders the HTML on service wide
        following user's preference.
