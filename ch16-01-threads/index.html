library only provides an implementation of 1:1 threading; there are crates that
implement other models of threading that make different tradeoffs.</p>

The return type of <code>thread::spawn</code> is <code>JoinHandle</code>. A <code>JoinHandle</code> is an owned
value that, when we call the <code>join</code> method on it, will wait for its thread to
finish. Listing 16-2 shows how to use the <code>JoinHandle</code> of the thread we created
in Listing 16-1 and call <code>join</code> to make sure the spawned thread finishes before
<code>main</code> exits:</p>

another. In the <a href="ch13-01-closures.html#capturing-the-environment-with-closures">“Capturing the Environment with Closures”</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> section of Chapter 13, we discussed <code>move</code> in the context of closures. Now,

spawned thread’s closure must capture the values it needs. Listing 16-3 shows
an attempt to create a vector in the main thread and use it in the spawned
thread. However, this won’t yet work, as you’ll see in a moment.</p>

We got an error from the code in Listing 16-3 because Rust was being conservative and only borrowing <code>v</code> for the thread, which meant the main thread could theoretically invalidate the spawned thread’s reference. By telling Rust to move ownership of <code>v</code> to the spawned thread, we’re guaranteeing Rust that the main thread won’t use <code>v</code> anymore. If we change Listing 16-4 in the same way, we’re then violating the ownership rules when we try to use <code>v</code> in the main thread. The <code>move</code> keyword overrides Rust’s conservative default of borrowing; it doesn’t let us violate the ownership rules.</div>

        fpm-ui.dark-mode behaviour:

        fpm-ui.dark-mode is a boolean, default false, it tells the UI to show
        the UI in dark or light mode. Themes should use this variable to decide
        which mode to show in UI.

        fpm-ui.dark-mode-follow-system, boolean, default true, keeps track if
        we are reading the value of `dark-mode` from system preference, or user
        has overridden the system preference.

        These two variables must not be set by ftd code directly, but they must
        use `$event-click$: message-host enable-dark-mode`, to ignore system
        preference and use dark mode. `$event-click$: message-host
        disable-dark-mode` to ignore system preference and use light mode and
        `$event-click$: message-host follow-system-dark-mode` to ignore user
        preference and start following system preference.

        we use a cookie: `fpm-dark-mode` to store the preference. The cookie can
        have three values:

           cookie missing /          user wants us to honour system preference
               system-light          and currently its light.

           system-dark               follow system and currently its dark.

           light:                    user prefers light

           dark:                     user prefers light

        We use cookie instead of localstorage so in future `fpm-repo` can see
        users preferences up front and renders the HTML on service wide
        following user's preference.
