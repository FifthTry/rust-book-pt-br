To define structs, enums, or function parameters that use closures,\\nwe use generics and trait bounds, as we discussed in Chapter 10.\\n\\nThe `Fn` traits are provided by the standard library. All closures implement at\\nleast one of the traits: `Fn`, `FnMut`, or `FnOnce`. We’ll discuss the\\ndifference between these traits in the [“Capturing the Environment with\\nClosures”](#capturing-the-environment-with-closures)\u003C!-- ignore --\u003E section; in\\nthis example, we can use the `Fn` trait.\\n\\nWe add types to the `Fn` trait bound to represent the types of the parameters\\nand return values the closures must have to match this trait bound. In this\\ncase, our closure has a parameter of type `u32` and returns a `u32`, so the\\ntrait bound we specify is `Fn(u32) -\u003E u32`.\\n\\nListing 13-9 shows the definition of the `Cacher` struct that holds a closure\\nand an optional result value.\\n\\n\u003Cspan class=\\\"filename\\\"\u003EFilename: src/main.rs\u003C/span\u003E\"",

the algorithm that generates the workout plan takes into account many factors,

workouts, and an intensity number they specify. The actual algorithm used isn’t
important in this example; what’s important is that this calculation takes a
few seconds. We want to call this algorithm only when we need to and only call
it once so we don’t make the user wait more than necessary.</p>

This function represents the code that the app will call when a user asks for a workout plan. Because the interaction with the app’s frontend isn’t relevant to the use of closures, we’ll hardcode values representing inputs to our program and print the outputs.</div>

To define a closure, we start with a pair of vertical pipes (<code>|</code>), inside which we specify the parameters to the closure; this syntax was chosen because of its similarity to closure definitions in Smalltalk and Ruby. This closure has one parameter named <code>num</code>: if we had more than one parameter, we would separate them with commas, like <code>|param1, param2|</code>.</div>

The end of the closure, after the curly brackets, needs a semicolon to complete the <code>let</code> statement. The value returned from the last line in the closure body (<code>num</code>) will be the value returned from the closure when it’s called, because that line doesn’t end in a semicolon; just as in function bodies.</div>

Recall that we’re using a closure because we want to define the code to call at one point, store that code, and call it at a later point; the code we want to call is now stored in <code>expensive_closure</code>.</div>

We could fix this problem by creating a variable local to that <code>if</code> block to hold the result of calling the closure, but closures provide us with another solution. We’ll talk about that solution in a bit. But first let’s talk about why there aren’t type annotations in the closure definition and the traits involved with closures.</div></div></div></div></div>

return value like <code>fn</code> functions do. Type annotations are required on functions
because they’re part of an explicit interface exposed to your users. Defining
this interface rigidly is important for ensuring that everyone agrees on what
types of values a function uses and returns. But closures aren’t used in an
exposed interface like this: they’re stored in variables and used without
naming them and exposing them to users of our library.</p>

calling the expensive calculation closure more times than it needed to. One
option to solve this issue is to save the result of the expensive closure in a
variable for reuse and use the variable in each place we need the result,
instead of calling the closure again. However, this method could result in a
lot of repeated code.</p>

We can create a struct that
will hold the closure and the resulting value of calling the closure. The
struct will execute the closure only if we need the resulting value, and it
will cache the resulting value so the rest of our code doesn’t have to be
responsible for saving and reusing the result. You may know this pattern as
<em>memoization</em> or <em>lazy evaluation</em>.</p>

closure, because a struct definition needs to know the types of each of its
fields. Each closure instance has its own unique anonymous type: that is, even
if two closures have the same signature, their types are still considered
different. To define structs, enums, or function parameters that use closures,
we use generics and trait bounds, as we discussed in Chapter 10.</p>

All closures implement at
least one of the traits: <code>Fn</code>, <code>FnMut</code>, or <code>FnOnce</code>. We’ll discuss the
difference between these traits in the <a href="#capturing-the-environment-with-closures">“Capturing the Environment with
Closures”</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> section; in
this example, we can use the <code>Fn</code> trait.</p>

and return values the closures must have to match this trait bound. In this
case, our closure has a parameter of type <code>u32</code> and returns a <code>u32</code>, so the
trait bound we specify is <code>Fn(u32) -&gt; u32</code>.</p>

Instead of looking at whether <code>self.value</code> directly has a <code>Some</code> or a <code>None</code> value, the <code>value</code> function will look up the <code>arg</code> in the hash map and return the value if it’s present.

To consume the captured variables, the closure must take ownership of these variables and move them into the closure when it is defined. The <code>Once</code> part of the name represents the fact that the closure can’t take ownership of the same variables more than once, so it can be called only once.</li> <li><code>FnMut</code> can change the environment because it mutably borrows values.</li> <li><code>Fn</code> borrows values from the environment immutably.</li> </ul></div>

All closures implement <code>FnOnce</code> because they can all be called at least once. Closures that don’t move the captured variables also implement <code>FnMut</code>, and closures that don’t need mutable access to the captured variables also implement <code>Fn</code>. In Listing 13-12, the <code>equal_to_x</code> closure borrows <code>x</code> immutably (so <code>equal_to_x</code> has the <code>Fn</code> trait) because the body of the closure only needs to read the value in <code>x</code>.</div>

This technique is mostly useful when passing a closure to a new thread to move the data so it’s owned by the new thread.</div>

This is because the traits implemented by a closure type are determined by what the closure does with captured values, not how it captures them. The <code>move</code> keyword only specifies the latter.</p> </blockquote></div>

        fpm-ui.dark-mode behaviour:

        fpm-ui.dark-mode is a boolean, default false, it tells the UI to show
        the UI in dark or light mode. Themes should use this variable to decide
        which mode to show in UI.

        fpm-ui.dark-mode-follow-system, boolean, default true, keeps track if
        we are reading the value of `dark-mode` from system preference, or user
        has overridden the system preference.

        These two variables must not be set by ftd code directly, but they must
        use `$event-click$: message-host enable-dark-mode`, to ignore system
        preference and use dark mode. `$event-click$: message-host
        disable-dark-mode` to ignore system preference and use light mode and
        `$event-click$: message-host follow-system-dark-mode` to ignore user
        preference and start following system preference.

        we use a cookie: `fpm-dark-mode` to store the preference. The cookie can
        have three values:

           cookie missing /          user wants us to honour system preference
               system-light          and currently its light.

           system-dark               follow system and currently its dark.

           light:                    user prefers light

           dark:                     user prefers light

        We use cookie instead of localstorage so in future `fpm-repo` can see
        users preferences up front and renders the HTML on service wide
        following user's preference.
