In this context, a *bad state* is when some\\nassumption, guarantee, contract, or invariant has been broken, such as when\\ninvalid values, contradictory values, or missing values are passed to your\\ncode—plus one or more of the following:\\n\\n* The bad state is something that is unexpected, as opposed to something that\\n  will likely happen occasionally, like a user entering data in the wrong\\n  format.\\n* Your code after this point needs to rely on not being in this bad state,\\n  rather than checking for the problem at every step.\\n* There’s not a good way to encode this information in the types you use. We’ll\\n  work through an example of what we mean in the [“Encoding States and Behavior\\n  as Types”](ch17-03-oo-design-patterns.html#encoding-states-and-behavior-as-types)\u003C!-- ignore --\u003E section of Chapter 17.\\n\\nIf someone calls your code and passes in values that don’t make sense, the best\\nchoice might be to call `panic!` and alert the person using your library to the\\nbug in their code so they can fix it during development. Similarly, `panic!` is\\noften appropriate if you’re calling external code that is out of your control\\nand it returns an invalid state that you have no way of fixing.\\n\\nHowever, when failure is expected, it’s more appropriate to return a `Result`\\nthan to make a `panic!` call. Examples include a parser being given malformed\\ndata or an HTTP request returning a status that indicates you have hit a rate\\nlimit. In these cases, returning a `Result` indicates that failure is an\\nexpected possibility that the calling code must decide how to handle.\\n\\nWhen your code performs operations on values, your code should verify the\\nvalues are valid first and panic if the values aren’t valid. This is mostly for\\nsafety reasons: attempting to operate on invalid data can expose your code to\\nvulnerabilities. This is the main reason the standard library will call\\n`panic!` if you attempt an out-of-bounds memory access: trying to access memory\\nthat doesn’t belong to the current data structure is a common security problem.\\nFunctions often have *contracts*: their behavior is only guaranteed if the\\ninputs meet particular requirements. Panicking when the contract is violated\\nmakes sense because a contract violation always indicates a caller-side bug and\\nit’s not a kind of error you want the calling code to have to explicitly\\nhandle. In fact, there’s no reasonable way for calling code to recover; the\\ncalling *programmers* need to fix the code. Contracts for a function,\\nespecially when a violation will cause a panic, should be explained in the API\\ndocumentation for the function.\\n\\nHowever, having lots of error checks in all of your functions would be verbose\\nand annoying. Fortunately, you can use Rust’s type system (and thus the type\\nchecking done by the compiler) to do many of the checks for you. If your\\nfunction has a particular type as a parameter, you can proceed with your code’s\\nlogic knowing that the compiler has already ensured you have a valid value.

    "value": "\"It’s advisable to have your code panic when it’s possible that your code\\ncould end up in a bad state. In this context, a *bad state* is when some\\nassumption, guarantee, contract, or invariant has been broken, such as when\\ninvalid values, contradictory values, or missing values are passed to your\\ncode—plus one or more of the following:\\n\\n* The bad state is something that is unexpected, as opposed to something that\\n  will likely happen occasionally, like a user entering data in the wrong\\n  format.\\n* Your code after this point needs to rely on not being in this bad state,\\n  rather than checking for the problem at every step.\\n* There’s not a good way to encode this information in the types you use. We’ll\\n  work through an example of what we mean in the [“Encoding States and Behavior\\n  as Types”](ch17-03-oo-design-patterns.html#encoding-states-and-behavior-as-types)\u003C!-- ignore --\u003E section of Chapter 17.\\n\\nIf someone calls your code and passes in values that don’t make sense, the best\\nchoice might be to call `panic!` and alert the person using your library to the\\nbug in their code so they can fix it during development. Similarly, `panic!` is\\noften appropriate if you’re calling external code that is out of your control\\nand it returns an invalid state that you have no way of fixing.\\n\\nHowever, when failure is expected, it’s more appropriate to return a `Result`\\nthan to make a `panic!` call. Examples include a parser being given malformed\\ndata or an HTTP request returning a status that indicates you have hit a rate\\nlimit. In these cases, returning a `Result` indicates that failure is an\\nexpected possibility that the calling code must decide how to handle.\\n\\nWhen your code performs operations on values, your code should verify the\\nvalues are valid first and panic if the values aren’t valid. This is mostly for\\nsafety reasons: attempting to operate on invalid data can expose your code to\\nvulnerabilities. This is the main reason the standard library will call\\n`panic!` if you attempt an out-of-bounds memory access: trying to access memory\\nthat doesn’t belong to the current data structure is a common security problem.\\nFunctions often have *contracts*: their behavior is only guaranteed if the\\ninputs meet particular requirements. Panicking when the contract is violated\\nmakes sense because a contract violation always indicates a caller-side bug and\\nit’s not a kind of error you want the calling code to have to explicitly\\nhandle. In fact, there’s no reasonable way for calling code to recover; the\\ncalling *programmers* need to fix the code. Contracts for a function,\\nespecially when a violation will cause a panic, should be explained in the API\\ndocumentation for the function.\\n\\nHowever, having lots of error checks in all of your functions would be verbose\\nand annoying. Fortunately, you can use Rust’s type system (and thus the type\\nchecking done by the compiler) to do many of the checks for you. If your\\nfunction has a particular type as a parameter, you can proceed with your code’s\\nlogic knowing that the compiler has already ensured you have a valid value. For\\nexample, if you have a type rather than an `Option`, your program expects to\\nhave *something* rather than *nothing*. Your code then doesn’t have to handle\\ntwo cases for the `Some` and `None` variants: it will only have one case for\\ndefinitely having a value.

<code>Result</code>? When code panics, there’s no way to recover. You could call <code>panic!</code>
for any error situation, whether there’s a possible way to recover or not, but
then you’re making the decision that a situation is unrecoverable on behalf of
the calling code. When you choose to return a <code>Result</code> value, you give the
calling code options. The calling code could choose to attempt to recover in a
way that’s appropriate for its situation, or it could decide that an <code>Err</code>
value in this case is unrecoverable, so it can call <code>panic!</code> and turn your
recoverable error into an unrecoverable one. Therefore, returning <code>Result</code> is a
good default choice when you’re defining a function that might fail.</p>

appropriate to write code that panics instead of returning a <code>Result</code>. Let’s

failure is impossible, but you as a human can. The chapter will conclude with
some general guidelines on how to decide whether to panic in library code.</p>

error-handling code can make the example less clear. In
examples, it’s understood that a call to a method like <code>unwrap</code> that could
panic is meant as a placeholder for the way you’d want your application to
handle errors, which can differ based on what the rest of your code is doing.</p>

could end up in a bad state. In this context, a <em>bad state</em> is when some
assumption, guarantee, contract, or invariant has been broken, such as when
invalid values, contradictory values, or missing values are passed to your
code—plus one or more of the following:</p>
</p>
<p data-id="0,0,0,1,2,1,0,1:main-container-external:0.inner-external:0,0,0:main" style="border-radius: 0px; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; text-align: left; white-space: initial" class="ft_md"><ul>
<li>The bad state is something that is unexpected, as opposed to something that
will likely happen occasionally, like a user entering data in the wrong
format.</li>
<li>Your code after this point needs to rely on not being in this bad state,
rather than checking for the problem at every step.</li>
<li>There’s not a good way to encode this information in the types you use. We’ll
work through an example of what we mean in the <a href="ch17-03-oo-design-patterns.html#encoding-states-and-behavior-as-types">“Encoding States and Behavior
as Types”</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> section of Chapter 17.</li>

choice might be to call <code>panic!</code> and alert the person using your library to the
bug in their code so they can fix it during development. Similarly, <code>panic!</code> is
often appropriate if you’re calling external code that is out of your control
and it returns an invalid state that you have no way of fixing.</p>

than to make a <code>panic!</code> call. Examples include a parser being given malformed

expected possibility that the calling code must decide how to handle.</p>

values are valid first and panic if the values aren’t valid. This is mostly for
safety reasons: attempting to operate on invalid data can expose your code to
vulnerabilities. This is the main reason the standard library will call
<code>panic!</code> if you attempt an out-of-bounds memory access: trying to access memory
that doesn’t belong to the current data structure is a common security problem.
Functions often have <em>contracts</em>: their behavior is only guaranteed if the
inputs meet particular requirements. Panicking when the contract is violated
makes sense because a contract violation always indicates a caller-side bug and
it’s not a kind of error you want the calling code to have to explicitly
handle. In fact, there’s no reasonable way for calling code to recover; the
calling <em>programmers</em> need to fix the code. Contracts for a function,
especially when a violation will cause a panic, should be explained in the API

and annoying. Fortunately, you can use Rust’s type system (and thus the type
checking done by the compiler) to do many of the checks for you. If your
function has a particular type as a parameter, you can proceed with your code’s
logic knowing that the compiler has already ensured you have a valid value. For
example, if you have a type rather than an <code>Option</code>, your program expects to
have <em>something</em> rather than <em>nothing</em>. Your code then doesn’t have to handle
two cases for the <code>Some</code> and <code>None</code> variants: it will only have one case for
definitely having a value. Code trying to pass nothing to your function won’t
even compile, so your function doesn’t have to check for that case at runtime.
Another example is using an unsigned integer type such as <code>u32</code>, which ensures
the parameter is never negative.</p>

one step further and look at creating a custom type for validation. Recall the
guessing game in Chapter 2 in which our code asked the user to guess a number
between 1 and 100. We never validated that the user’s guess was between those
numbers before checking it against our secret number; we only validated that
the guess was positive. In this case, the consequences were not very dire: our
output of “Too high” or “Too low” would still be correct. But it would be a
useful enhancement to guide the user toward valid guesses and have different
behavior when a user guesses a number that’s out of range versus when a user
types, for example, letters instead.</p>

<code>u32</code> to allow potentially negative numbers, and then add a check for the
number being in range, like so:</p>

This public method is necessary because the <code>value</code> field of the <code>Guess</code> struct is private. It’s important that the <code>value</code> field be private so code using the <code>Guess</code> struct is not allowed to set <code>value</code> directly: code outside the module <em>must</em> use the <code>Guess::new</code> function to create an instance of <code>Guess</code>, thereby ensuring there’s no way for a <code>Guess</code> to have a <code>value</code> that hasn’t been checked by the conditions in the <code>Guess::new</code> function.</div>

The <code>panic!</code> macro signals that your program is in a state it can’t handle and
lets you tell the process to stop instead of trying to proceed with invalid or
incorrect values. The <code>Result</code> enum uses Rust’s type system to indicate that
operations might fail in a way that your code could recover from. You can use
<code>Result</code> to tell code that calls your code that it needs to handle potential
success or failure as well. Using <code>panic!</code> and <code>Result</code> in the appropriate
situations will make your code more reliable in the face of inevitable problems.</p>

the <code>Option</code> and <code>Result</code> enums, we’ll talk about how generics work and how you
can use them in your code.</p>

um <code>Result</code>? Quando o código entra em pânico, não há maneira de se recuperar. Você
poderia chamar <code>panic!</code> para qualquer situação de erro, tendo uma maneira de se recuperar
ou não, mas então você estaria decidindo no lugar do código que chama seu código
que a situação é irrecuperável. Quando você decide retornar um valor de <code>Result</code>,
você lhe dá opções em vez de tomar a decisão por ele. O código
que chama seu código pode tentar se recuperar de uma maneira que é apropriada para
a situação, ou ele pode decidir que um valor de <code>Err</code> nesse caso é irrecuperável,
chamando <code>panic!</code> e transformando seu erro recuperável em um irrecuperável.
Portanto, retornar <code>Result</code> é uma boa escolha padrão quando você está definindo
uma função que pode falhar.</p>

em que você como humano pode saber que um método não vai falhar, mas que o compilador não
tem como saber; e concluir com algumas diretrizes sobre como decidir entrar ou
não em pânico em código de biblioteca.</p>

de tratamento de erro robusto junto do exemplo pode torná-lo menos claro. Em exemplos,
é compreensível que uma chamada a um método como <code>unwrap</code> que poderia chamar <code>panic!</code>
apenas substitua a maneira como você trataria erros na sua aplicação,
que pode ser diferente baseado no que o resto do seu código está fazendo.</p>

ele entre em um mau estado. Nesse contexto, mau estado é quando
alguma hipótese, garantia, contrato ou invariante foi quebrada, tal como
valores inválidos, valores contraditórios, ou valores faltando que são passados
a seu código - além de um ou mais dos seguintes:</p>
</p>
<p data-id="0,0,0,1,2,1,0,1:main-container-external:0.inner-external:0,0,0:fallback" style="border-radius: 0px; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; text-align: left; white-space: initial" class="ft_md"><ul>
<li>O mau estado não é algo que é <em>esperado</em> que aconteça ocasionalmente.</li>
<li>Seu código após certo ponto precisa confiar que ele não está nesse mau estado.</li>
<li>Não há uma forma boa de codificar essa informação nos tipos que você usa.</li>
</ul>

<p data-id="0,0,0,1,2,1,0,2:main-container-external:0.inner-external:0,0,0:fallback" style="border-radius: 0px; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; text-align: left; white-space: initial" class="ft_md"><p>Se alguém chama seu código e passa valores que não fazem sentido, a melhor escolha
talvez seja entrar em <code>panic!</code> e alertar a pessoa usando sua biblioteca do bug no
código dela para que ela possa consertá-la durante o desenvolvimento. Similarmente,
<code>panic!</code> é em geral apropriado se você está chamando código externo que está fora
do seu controle e ele retorna um estado inválido que você não tem como consertar.</p>

quão bem você escreva seu código, ainda é mais apropriado retornar um <code>Result</code>
a fazer uma chamada a <code>panic!</code>. Um exemplo disso é um <em>parser</em> recebendo dados
malformados ou uma requisição HTTP retornando um status que indique que você atingiu
um limite de taxa. Nesses casos, você deveria indicar que falha é uma possibilidade
esperada ao retornar um <code>Result</code> para propagar esses estados ruins para cima,
de forma que o código que chamou seu código pode decidir como tratar o problema.
Entrar em <code>panic!</code> não seria a melhor maneira de lidar com esses casos.</p>
</p>
<p data-id="0,0,0,1,2,1,0,4:main-container-external:0.inner-external:0,0,0:fallback" style="border-radius: 0px; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; text-align: left; white-space: initial" class="ft_md"><p>Quando seu código realiza operações em valores, ele deveria verificar que os valores
são válidos primeiro, e entrar em <code>panic!</code> caso não sejam. Isso é
em boa parte por razões de segurança: tentar operar em dados inválidos pode expor seu
código a vulnerabilidades. Essa é a principal razão para a biblioteca padrão entrar em
<code>panic!</code> se você tentar um acesso de memória fora dos limites: tentar acessar memória
que não pertence à estrutura de dados atual é um problema de segurança comum. Funções
frequentemente tem <em>contratos</em>: seu comportamento somente é garantido se os inputs cumprem
requerimentos específicos. Entrar em pânico quando o contrato é violado faz sentido
porque uma violação de contrato sempre indica um bug da parte do chamador, e não é o tipo
de erro que você quer que seja tratado explicitamente. De fato,
não há nenhuma maneira razoável para o código chamador se recuperar: os <em>programadores</em>
que precisam consertar o código. Contratos para uma função, especialmente quando uma
violação leva a pânico, devem ser explicados na documentação da API da função.</p>

e irritante. Felizmente, você pode usar o sistema de tipos do Rust (e portanto a
checagem que o compilador faz) para fazer várias dessas checagens para você. Se
sua função tem um tipo particular como parâmetro, você pode continuar com a lógica
do seu código sabendo que o compilador já assegurou que você tem um valor válido.
Por exemplo, se você tem um tipo em vez de uma <code>Option</code>, seu programa espera
ter <em>algo</em> ao invés de <em>nada</em>. Seu código não precisa tratar dois casos para
as variantes <code>Some</code> e <code>None</code>: ele vai somente ter um caso para definitivamente ter
um valor. Um código que tente passar nada para sua função não vai nem compilar,
então sua função não precisa checar esse caso em tempo de execução. Outro exemplo é usar
um tipo de inteiro sem sinal como <code>u32</code>, que assegura que o parâmetro nunca é
negativo.</p>

Lembre do jogo de adivinhação no Capítulo 2 onde nosso código pedia ao usuário
para adivinhar um número entre 1 e 100. Nós nunca validamos que o chute do usuário
fosse entre esses números antes de compará-lo com o número secreto; nós somente
validamos que o chute era positivo. Nesse caso, as consequências não foram tão
drásticas: nosso output de “Muito alto” ou “Muito baixo” ainda estariam corretos. Seria
uma melhoria útil guiar o usuário para chutes válidos, e ter um comportamento distinto
quando um usuário chuta um número fora do limite e quando um usuário digita letras, por exemplo.</p>

O código no corpo da função <code>new</code> testa para ter certeza que <code>valor</code> está entre 1 e 100.

As condições em que <code>Palpite::new</code> pode entrar em pânico devem ser discutidas na sua documentação da API voltada ao público; no Capítulo 14 nós cobriremos convenções de documentação indicando a possibilidade de um <code>panic!</code> na documentação de API.

Esse método público é necessário porque o campo <code>valor</code> da struct <code>Palpite</code> é privado. É importante que o campo <code>valor</code> seja privado para que código usando a struct <code>Palpite</code> não tenha permissão de definir o valor de <code>valor</code> diretamente: código de fora do módulo <em>deve</em> usar a função <code>Palpite::new</code> para criar uma instância de <code>Palpite</code>, o que certifica que não há maneira de um <code>Palpite</code> ter um <code>valor</code> que não foi checado pelas condições definidas na função <code>Palpite::new</code>.</div>

código mais robusto. A macro <code>panic!</code> sinaliza que seu programa está num estado que
não consegue lidar e deixa você parar o processo ao invés de tentar prosseguir com
valores inválidos ou incorretos. O enum <code>Result</code> usa o sistema de tipos de Rust para
indicar que operações podem falhar de uma maneira que seu código pode se recuperar.
Você pode usar <code>Result</code> para dizer ao código que chama seu código que ele precisa
tratar potenciais sucessos ou falhas também. Usar <code>panic!</code> e <code>Result</code> nas situações
apropriadas fará seu código mais confiável em face aos problemas inevitáveis.</p>

    /*
        fpm-ui.dark-mode behaviour:

        fpm-ui.dark-mode is a boolean, default false, it tells the UI to show
        the UI in dark or light mode. Themes should use this variable to decide
        which mode to show in UI.

        fpm-ui.dark-mode-follow-system, boolean, default true, keeps track if
        we are reading the value of `dark-mode` from system preference, or user
        has overridden the system preference.

        These two variables must not be set by ftd code directly, but they must
        use `$event-click$: message-host enable-dark-mode`, to ignore system
        preference and use dark mode. `$event-click$: message-host
        disable-dark-mode` to ignore system preference and use light mode and
        `$event-click$: message-host follow-system-dark-mode` to ignore user
        preference and start following system preference.

        we use a cookie: `fpm-dark-mode` to store the preference. The cookie can
        have three values:

           cookie missing /          user wants us to honour system preference
               system-light          and currently its light.

           system-dark               follow system and currently its dark.

           light:                    user prefers light

           dark:                     user prefers light

        We use cookie instead of localstorage so in future `fpm-repo` can see
        users preferences up front and renders the HTML on service wide
        following user's preference.
