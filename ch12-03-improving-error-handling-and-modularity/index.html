reads files. For such a small function, this isn’t a major problem. However, if
we continue to grow our program inside <code>main</code>, the number of separate tasks the
<code>main</code> function handles will increase. As a function gains responsibilities, it
becomes more difficult to reason about, harder to test, and harder to change
without breaking one of its parts. It’s best to separate functionality so each
function is responsible for one task.</p>
</p>
<p data-id="0,0,0,1,0,2:main-container-external:0:main" style="border-radius: 0px; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; text-align: left; white-space: initial" class="ft_md"><p>This issue also ties into the second problem: although <code>query</code> and <code>filename</code>
are configuration variables to our program, variables like <code>contents</code> are used
to perform the program’s logic. The longer <code>main</code> becomes, the more variables
we’ll need to bring into scope; the more variables we have in scope, the harder
it will be to keep track of the purpose of each. It’s best to group the
configuration variables into one structure to make their purpose clear.</p>
</p>
<p data-id="0,0,0,1,0,3:main-container-external:0:main" style="border-radius: 0px; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; text-align: left; white-space: initial" class="ft_md"><p>The third problem is that we’ve used <code>expect</code> to print an error message when
reading the file fails, but the error message just prints <code>Something went wrong reading the file</code>. Reading a file can fail in a number of ways: for example,
the file could be missing, or we might not have permission to open it. Right
now, regardless of the situation, we’d print the <code>Something went wrong reading the file</code> error message, which wouldn’t give the user any information!</p>

runs our program without specifying enough arguments, they’ll get an <code>index out of bounds</code> error from Rust that doesn’t clearly explain the problem. It would
be best if all the error-handling code were in one place so future maintainers
had only one place to consult in the code if the error-handling logic needed to
change. Having all the error-handling code in one place will also ensure that
we’re printing messages that will be meaningful to our end users.</p>

<li>As long as your command line parsing logic is small, it can remain in

program, and <em>lib.rs</em> handles all the logic of the task at hand. Because you
can’t test the <code>main</code> function directly, this structure lets you test all of
your program’s logic by moving it into functions in <em>lib.rs</em>. The only code
that remains in <em>main.rs</em> will be small enough to verify its correctness by
reading it. Let’s rework our program by following this process.</p>

This will make a full copy of the data for the <code>Config</code> instance to own, which takes more time and memory than storing a reference to the string data. However, cloning the data also makes our code very straightforward because we don’t have to manage the lifetimes of the references; in this circumstance, giving up a little performance to gain simplicity is a worthwhile trade-off.</div>

In <a href="ch13-00-functional-features.html">Chapter 13</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, you’ll learn how to use more efficient methods in this type of situation. But for now, it’s okay to copy a few strings to continue making progress because you’ll make these copies only once and your filename and query string are very small. It’s better to have a working program that’s a bit inefficient than to try to hyperoptimize code on your first pass. As you become more experienced with Rust, it’ll be easier to start with the most efficient solution, but for now, it’s perfectly acceptable to call <code>clone</code>.</p> </blockquote></div>

arguments from <code>main</code> and placed it in the <code>parse_config</code> function. Doing so
helped us to see that the <code>query</code> and <code>filename</code> values were related and that
relationship should be conveyed in our code. We then added a <code>Config</code> struct to
name the related purpose of <code>query</code> and <code>filename</code> and to be able to return the
values’ names as struct field names from the <code>parse_config</code> function.</p>

instance, we can change <code>parse_config</code> from a plain function to a function
named <code>new</code> that is associated with the <code>Config</code> struct. Making this change
will make the code more idiomatic. We can create instances of types in the
standard library, such as <code>String</code>, by calling <code>String::new</code>. Similarly, by
changing <code>parse_config</code> into a <code>new</code> function associated with <code>Config</code>, we’ll
be able to create instances of <code>Config</code> by calling <code>Config::new</code>. Listing 12-7
shows the changes we need to make.</p>

Using <code>unwrap_or_else</code> allows us to define some custom, non-<code>panic!</code> error handling. If the <code>Result</code> is an <code>Ok</code> value, this method’s behavior is similar to <code>unwrap</code>: it returns the inner value <code>Ok</code> is wrapping. However, if the value is an <code>Err</code> value, this method calls the code in the <em>closure</em>, which is an anonymous function we define and pass as an argument to <code>unwrap_or_else</code>. We’ll cover closures in more detail in <a href="ch13-00-functional-features.html">Chapter 13</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. For now, you just need to know that <code>unwrap_or_else</code> will pass the inner value of the <code>Err</code>, which in this case is the static string <code>&quot;not enough arguments&quot;</code> that we added in Listing 12-9, to our closure in the argument <code>err</code> that appears between the vertical pipes. The code in the closure can then use the <code>err</code> value when it runs.</div>

This is similar to the <code>panic!</code>-based handling we used in Listing 12-8, but we no longer get all the extra output. Let’s try it:</div>

First, we changed the return type of the <code>run</code> function to <code>Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;&gt;</code>. This function previously returned the unit type, <code>()</code>, and we keep that as the value returned in the <code>Ok</code> case.</div>

We’ll cover trait objects in <a href="ch17-00-oop.html">Chapter 17</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. For now, just know that <code>Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;</code> means the function will return a type that implements the <code>Error</code> trait, but we don’t have to specify what particular type the return value will be. This gives us flexibility to return error values that may be of different types in different error cases. The <code>dyn</code> keyword is short for “dynamic.”</div>
<div data-ext-id="main-container-external:0.inner-external:0,0,0.inner-external:0,0,0,1,2.inner-external:0,0,0,1,2,1,3:main" data-id="0,0,0,1,2,1,3,1,4:main-container-external:0.inner-external:0,0,0.inner-external:0,0,0,1,2.inner-external:0,0,0,1,2,1,3:main" style="border-radius: 0px; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(10,26,31,1); font-family: apple-system; font-size: 15px; font-weight: 400; line-height: 24px; padding-bottom: 8px; text-align: left; white-space: initial" class="ft_md">Second, we’ve removed the call to <code>expect</code> in favor of the <code>?</code> operator, as we talked about in <a href="ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html#a-shortcut-for-propagating-errors-the--operator">Chapter 9</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Rather than <code>panic!</code> on an error, <code>?</code> will return the error value from the current function for the caller to handle.</div>

We’ve declared the <code>run</code> function’s success type as <code>()</code> in the signature, which means we need to wrap the unit type value in the <code>Ok</code> value. This <code>Ok(())</code> syntax might look a bit strange at first, but using <code>()</code> like this is the idiomatic way to indicate that we’re calling <code>run</code> for its side effects only; it doesn’t return a value we need.</div>

estrutura do programa e como ele está tratando possíveis erros.</p>
</p>
<p data-id="0,0,0,1,0,1:main-container-external:0:fallback" style="border-radius: 0px; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; text-align: left; white-space: initial" class="ft_md"><p>Primeiro, a nossa função <code>main</code> agora executa duas tarefas: analisa argumentos e
abre arquivos. Para uma função tão pequena, este não é um grande problema. No entanto, se
continuamos a desenvolver o nosso programa dentro de <code>main</code>, o número de tarefas separadas que
a função <code>main</code> manipula aumentarão. Com uma função ganhando responsabilidades,
torna-se mais difícil de raciocinar, mais difícil de testar e mais difícil de mudar
sem quebrar uma das suas partes. É melhor separar a funcionalidade para que cada
função seja responsável por uma tarefa.</p>
</p>
<p data-id="0,0,0,1,0,2:main-container-external:0:fallback" style="border-radius: 0px; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; text-align: left; white-space: initial" class="ft_md"><p>Esta questão também se liga ao segundo problema: embora <code>query</code> e <code>filename</code>
sejam variáveis de configuração para o nosso programa, variáveis como <code>f</code> e <code>contents</code>
são usadas para executar a lógica do programa. Quanto maior o <code>main</code> se torna, mais
variáveis precisamos trazer no escopo; quanto mais variáveis temos no escopo,
mais difícil será acompanhar o objetivo de cada uma. É melhor agrupar
as variáveis de configuração em uma estrutura para tornar claro seu objetivo.</p>
</p>
<p data-id="0,0,0,1,0,3:main-container-external:0:fallback" style="border-radius: 0px; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; text-align: left; white-space: initial" class="ft_md"><p>O terceiro problema é que usamos <code>expect</code> para imprimir uma mensagem de erro, ao
abrir um arquivo, falha, mas a mensagem de erro apenas imprime <code>file not found</code>.
Abrir um arquivo pode falhar de várias maneiras, além do arquivo faltando: como
exemplo, o arquivo pode existir, mas talvez não possamos ter permissão para abri-lo.
Agora, se estivermos nessa situação, imprimiríamos a mensagem de erro <code>file not found</code>
que daria ao usuário a informação errada!</p>
</p>
<p data-id="0,0,0,1,0,4:main-container-external:0:fallback" style="border-radius: 0px; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; text-align: left; white-space: initial" class="ft_md"><p>O quarto problema, usamos <code>expect</code> repetidamente para lidar com diferentes erros, e se o usuário
executa o nosso programa sem especificar argumentos suficientes, eles terão erros <code>index out of bounds</code> do Rust, que não explica claramente o problema. Seria
melhor se todo o código de tratamento de erros estiver em um só lugar para futuros mantenedores
terem apenas um lugar para consultar, no código, se a lógica de tratamento de erros precisar de
mudança. Ter todo o código de tratamento de erros em um só lugar também assegurará que
estamos imprimindo mensagens que serão significativas para nossos usuários finais.</p>

a função <code>main</code> é comum a muitos projetos binários. Como resultado, a comunidade Rust
desenvolveu um tipo de processo de orientação para dividir as
responsabilidades de um programa binário quando <code>main</code> começa a ficar grande. O processo tem
as seguintes etapas:</p>
</p>
<p data-id="0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1:main-container-external:0.inner-external:0,0,0:fallback" style="border-radius: 0px; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; text-align: left; white-space: initial" class="ft_md"><ul>
<li>Divida seu programa em um <em>main.rs</em> e um <em>lib.rs</em>, e mova a lógica
do seu programa para <em>lib.rs</em>.</li>
<li>Enquanto sua lógica de análise de linha de comando é pequena, ela pode permanecer em <em>main.rs</em>.</li>
<li>Quando a lógica de análise de linha de comando começa a ficar complicada, extraia
de <em>main.rs</em> e mova para <em>lib.rs</em>.</li>
<li>As responsabilidades que permanecem na função <code>main</code> depois desse processo
deve estar limitado a:</li>
</ul>

<li>Chamar a lógica de análise de linha de comando com os valores do argumento</li>
<li>Ajustar qualquer outra configuração</li>
<li>Chamando uma função <code>run</code> em <em>lib.rs</em></li>
<li>Manipulação do erro se <code>run</code> retornar um erro</li>
</ul>

programa e <em>lib.rs</em> lida com toda a lógica da tarefa em questão. Porque nós
não podemos testar diretamente a função <code>main</code>, esta estrutura nos permite testar toda
lógica do programa, movendo-a para funções em <em>lib.rs</em>. O único código que
permanece em <em>main.rs</em> será pequeno o suficiente para verificar se está correto com
uma leitura rápida. Vamos retrabalhar o nosso programa seguindo este processo.</p>

Mas por agora, é bom copiar algumas strings para continuar a fazer progresso porque iremos fazer essas cópias apenas uma vez, e nosso nome de arquivo e seqüência de consulta são muito pequenos. É melhor ter um programa de trabalho que seja um pouco ineficiente do que tentar hiper-optimizar o código na sua primeira passagem. À medida que você se torna mais experiente com Rust, será mais fácil começar com a solução mais eficiente, mas para agora, é perfeitamente aceitável chamar <code>clone</code>.</p> </blockquote></div>

Usar <code>unwrap_or_else</code> nos permite definir algum erro personalizado, não-<code>panic!</code> de manipulação. Se o <code>Result</code> for um valor <code>Ok</code>, o comportamento deste método é semelhante a <code>unwrap</code>: ele retorna o valor interno <code>Ok</code>. No entanto, se o valor é um valor <code>Err</code>, este método chama o código na <em>closure</em>, que é uma função anônima que definimos e passamos como um argumento para <code>unwrap_or_else</code>. Nós entraremos em detalhes sobre closures no Capítulo 13. Por enquanto, você precisa apenas saber que <code>unwrap_or_else</code> passará o valor interno do <code>Err</code>, que neste caso é a string estática <code>not enough arguments</code> que adicionamos na Listagem 12-9, para o nosso closure no argumento <code>err</code> que aparece entre os pipes verticais. O código no closure pode então usar o valor <code>err</code> quando ele é executado.</div>

O código na closure que será executado no caso de erro são apenas duas linhas: nós imprimos o valor de <code>err</code> e depois chamamos <code>process::exit</code>. A função <code>process::exit</code> interromperá o programa imediatamente e retornará o número que foi passado como o código de status de saída. Isso é semelhante ao manuseio baseado no <code>panic!</code> que usamos na Listagem 12-8, mas já não obtemos todos os resultados extras. Vamos tentar isto:</div>

retornará um <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> quando algo der errado. Isso permitirá
nos permitirá consolidar ainda mais na lógica principal a manipulação de erros em uma

Vamos cobrir objetos trait no Capítulo 17. Por enquanto, apenas saiba que <code>Box&lt;Error&gt;</code> significa que a função retornará um tipo que implemente o trait <code>Error</code>, mas não temos que especificar qual tipo em particular o valor de retorno será. Isso nos dá flexibilidade para retornar valores de erro que podem ser de diferentes tipos em diferentes casos de erro.</div>

Nós declaramos o tipo de sucesso da função <code>run</code> como <code>()</code> na assinatura, que significa que precisamos wrap (envolver) o valor do tipo de unidade no valor <code>Ok</code>. Esta sintaxe <code>Ok(())</code> pode parecer um pouco estranha no início, mas usar <code>()</code> como este é o maneira idiomática de indicar que chamamos <code>run</code> para seus efeitos colaterais somente; ele não retorna o valor que precisamos.</div>

        fpm-ui.dark-mode behaviour:

        fpm-ui.dark-mode is a boolean, default false, it tells the UI to show
        the UI in dark or light mode. Themes should use this variable to decide
        which mode to show in UI.

        fpm-ui.dark-mode-follow-system, boolean, default true, keeps track if
        we are reading the value of `dark-mode` from system preference, or user
        has overridden the system preference.

        These two variables must not be set by ftd code directly, but they must
        use `$event-click$: message-host enable-dark-mode`, to ignore system
        preference and use dark mode. `$event-click$: message-host
        disable-dark-mode` to ignore system preference and use light mode and
        `$event-click$: message-host follow-system-dark-mode` to ignore user
        preference and start following system preference.

        we use a cookie: `fpm-dark-mode` to store the preference. The cookie can
        have three values:

           cookie missing /          user wants us to honour system preference
               system-light          and currently its light.

           system-dark               follow system and currently its dark.

           light:                    user prefers light

           dark:                     user prefers light

        We use cookie instead of localstorage so in future `fpm-repo` can see
        users preferences up front and renders the HTML on service wide
        following user's preference.
