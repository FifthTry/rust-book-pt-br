it. In these cases, Rust has the <code>panic!</code> macro. When the <code>panic!</code> macro
executes, your program will print a failure message, unwind and clean up the
stack, and then quit. We’ll commonly invoke a panic when a bug of some kind has
been detected and it’s not clear how to handle the problem at the time we’re
writing our program.</p>

<h3>Unwinding the Stack or Aborting in Response to a Panic</h3>
<p>By default, when a panic occurs, the program starts <em>unwinding</em>, which
means Rust walks back up the stack and cleans up the data from each function
it encounters. However, this walking back and cleanup is a lot of work. Rust,
therefore, allows you to choose the alternative of immediately <em>aborting</em>,
which ends the program without cleaning up. Memory that the program was using
will then need to be cleaned up by the operating system. If in your project
you need to make the resulting binary as small as possible, you can switch
from unwinding to aborting upon a panic by adding <code>panic = 'abort'</code> to the
appropriate <code>[profile]</code> sections in your <em>Cargo.toml</em> file. For example, if
you want to abort on panic in release mode, add this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[profile.release]
panic = 'abort'
</code></pre>

In other cases, the <code>panic!</code> call might be in code that our code calls, and the filename and line number reported by the error message will be someone else’s code where the <code>panic!</code> macro is called, not the line of our code that eventually led to the <code>panic!</code> call. We can use the backtrace of the functions the <code>panic!</code> call came from to figure out the part of our code that is causing the problem. We’ll discuss backtraces in more detail next.</div>

get to this point. Backtraces in Rust work as they do in other languages: the
key to reading the backtrace is to start from the top and read until you see
files you wrote. That’s the spot where the problem originated. The lines above
that spot are code that your code has called; the lines below are code that
called your code. These before-and-after lines might include core Rust code,
standard library code, or crates that you’re using. Let’s try getting a
backtrace by setting the <code>RUST_BACKTRACE</code> environment variable to any value
except 0. Listing 9-2 shows output similar to what you’ll see.</p>

If we don’t want our program to panic, we should start our investigation at the location pointed to by the first line mentioning a file we wrote. In Listing 9-1, where we deliberately wrote code that would panic, the way to fix the panic is to not request an element beyond the range of the vector indexes. When your code panics in the future, you’ll need to figure out what action the code is taking with what values to cause the panic and what the code should do instead.</div>

<h3>Resolver a Pilha ou Abortar em Resposta a <code>panic!</code></h3>
<p>Por padrão, quando acontece um <code>panic!</code>, o programa começa a <em>resolver</em> a pilha,
o que significa que Rust percorre a pilha e limpa os dados de cada função que encontra.
Mas essa limpeza dá bastante trabalho. A alternativa é imediatamente <em>abortar</em>,
que termina o programa sem fazer a limpeza. A memória que o programa estava usando vai então
precisar ser limpada pelo sistema operacional. Se no seu projeto você precisa tornar
o binário final o menor possível, você pode deixar de resolver e sim abortar no <em>panic</em>
adicionando <code>panic = 'abort'</code> à seção apropriadada de <code>[profile]</code> no seu arquivo
<em>Cargo.toml</em>. Por exemplo, se você quiser abortar no <em>panic</em> no modo de <em>release</em>, adicione
isso:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[profile.release]
panic = 'abort'

Um <em>backtrace</em> é uma lista de todas as funções que foram chamadas para chegar a esse ponto. <em>Backtraces</em> em Rust funcionam como em outras linguagens: a chave para ler o <em>backtrace</em> é começar do topo e ler até você ver os arquivos que você escreveu. Esse é o ponto em que o problema se originou. As linhas acima das que mencionam seu código são funções que você chamou; as linhas abaixo são funções que chamaram seu código. Essas linhas podem incluir código do núcleo do Rust, código das bibliotecas padrão, ou <em>crates</em> que você está usando. Vamos tentar ver um backtrace: a Listagem 9-2 mostra uma saída semelhante a o que você verá:</div>

queremos que nosso programa entre em pânico, a localização apontada pela primeira
linha mencionando um arquivo que escrevemos é onde deveríamos começar a investigar
para entender como chegamos nesse ponto com valores que causaram o pânico. Na lista
9-1 onde nós deliberadamente escrevemos código que causaria pânico para demonstrar
como usar <em>backtraces</em>, a forma de consertar o pânico é não requisitar um elemento
no índice 100 de um vetor que contém apenas três itens. Quando seu código entrar
em pânico no futuro, você precisará descobrir quais ações o seu código está tomando,
e com quais valores, que estão causando o pânico, e o que deveria ser feito em vez
disso.</p>

        fpm-ui.dark-mode behaviour:

        fpm-ui.dark-mode is a boolean, default false, it tells the UI to show
        the UI in dark or light mode. Themes should use this variable to decide
        which mode to show in UI.

        fpm-ui.dark-mode-follow-system, boolean, default true, keeps track if
        we are reading the value of `dark-mode` from system preference, or user
        has overridden the system preference.

        These two variables must not be set by ftd code directly, but they must
        use `$event-click$: message-host enable-dark-mode`, to ignore system
        preference and use dark mode. `$event-click$: message-host
        disable-dark-mode` to ignore system preference and use light mode and
        `$event-click$: message-host follow-system-dark-mode` to ignore user
        preference and start following system preference.

        we use a cookie: `fpm-dark-mode` to store the preference. The cookie can
        have three values:

           cookie missing /          user wants us to honour system preference
               system-light          and currently its light.

           system-dark               follow system and currently its dark.

           light:                    user prefers light

           dark:                     user prefers light

        We use cookie instead of localstorage so in future `fpm-repo` can see
        users preferences up front and renders the HTML on service wide
        following user's preference.
