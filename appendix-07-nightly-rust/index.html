We want
Rust to be a rock-solid foundation you can build on, and if things were
constantly changing, that would be impossible. At the same time, if we can’t
experiment with new features, we may not find out important flaws until after
their release, when we can no longer change things.</p>

and our guiding principle is this: you should never have to fear upgrading to a
new version of stable Rust. Each upgrade should be painless, but should also
bring you new features, fewer bugs, and faster compile times.</p>

done on the <code>master</code> branch of the Rust repository. Releases follow a software
release train model, which has been used by Cisco IOS and other software
projects. There are three <em>release channels</em> for Rust:</p>

assume that the Rust team is working on the release of Rust 1.5. That release
happened in December of 2015, but it will provide us with realistic version
numbers. A new feature is added to Rust: a new commit lands on the <code>master</code>
branch. Each night, a new nightly version of Rust is produced. Every day is a
release day, and these releases are created by our release infrastructure
automatically. So as time passes, our releases look like this, once a night:</p>

If you know the date of one Rust release, you can know the date of the next one: it’s six weeks later. A nice aspect of having releases scheduled every six weeks is that the next train is coming soon. If a feature happens to miss a particular release, there’s no need to worry: another one is happening in a short time!

Rust uses a
technique called “feature flags” to determine what features are enabled in a
given release. If a new feature is under active development, it lands on
<code>master</code>, and therefore, in nightly, but behind a <em>feature flag</em>. If you, as a
user, wish to try out the work-in-progress feature, you can, but you must be
using a nightly release of Rust and annotate your source code with the
appropriate flag to opt in.</p>

flags. This is the key that allows us to get practical use with new features
before we declare them stable forever. Those who wish to opt into the bleeding
edge can do so, and those who want a rock-solid experience can stick with
stable and know that their code won’t break. Stability without stagnation.</p>

discussed by the Rust team, which is comprised of many topic subteams. There’s
a full list of the teams <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/governance">on Rust’s
website</a>, which includes teams for
each area of the project: language design, compiler implementation,
infrastructure, documentation, and more. The appropriate team reads the
proposal and the comments, writes some comments of their own, and eventually,
there’s consensus to accept or reject the feature.</p>

someone can implement it. The person who implements it very well may not be the
person who proposed the feature in the first place! When the implementation is
ready, it lands on the <code>master</code> branch behind a feature gate, as we discussed
in the <a href="#unstable-features">“Unstable Features”</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> section.</p>

to try out the new feature, team members will discuss the feature, how it’s
worked out on nightly, and decide if it should make it into stable Rust or not.
If the decision is to move forward, the feature gate is removed, and the
feature is now considered stable! It rides the trains into a new stable release
of Rust.</p>

Queremos que o Rust seja uma base sólida sobre a qual você possa construir,
e se as coisas estivessem mudando constantemente, isso seria impossível. Ao
mesmo tempo, se não pudermos experimentar novos recursos, poderemos descobrir
falhas importantes somente após o lançamento, quando não podemos mais mudar as
coisas.</p>

rápidos.</p>

um novo commit é feito na <em>branch</em> <code>master</code>.
Todas as noites, uma nova versão <em>Nightly</em> do Rust é produzida. Todo dia é um
dia de lançamento e esses lançamentos são criados automaticamente por nossa
infraestrutura de lançamento. Assim, com o passar do tempo, nossos lançamentos
ficam assim, uma vez por noite:</p>

Se você souber a data de um lançamento do Rust, poderá saber a data do próximo: seis semanas depois. Um aspecto interessante de ter lançamentos agendados a cada seis semanas é que o próximo trem estará chegando em breve. Se um recurso falhar em uma versão específica, não há necessidade de se preocupar: outra está acontecendo em pouco tempo! Isso ajuda a reduzir a pressão para ocultar recursos possivelmente “não polidos” perto do prazo de lançamento.</div>

A quebra de uma versão beta é relativamente rara, mas o <code>rustc</code> ainda é um software, e bugs existem.</div>

O Rust usa uma técnica chamada “sinalizadores de recursos” para determinar quais
recursos estão ativados em uma determinada <em>release</em>. Se um novo recurso estiver
em desenvolvimento ativo, ele pousará na <em>branch</em> <code>master</code> e, logo, no
<em>Nightly</em>, mas atrás de um sinalizador de recurso.
Se você, como usuário, deseja experimentar o recurso de trabalho em andamento,
pode, mas deve estar usando uma versão <em>Nightly</em> do Rust e anotar seu
código-fonte com o sinalizador apropriado para ativar.</p>

qualquer sinalizador de recurso. Essa é a chave que nos permite usar de forma
prática os novos recursos antes de declará-los estáveis para sempre. Aqueles que
desejam optar pelo que há de mais moderno podem fazê-lo, e aqueles que desejam
uma experiência sólida podem se manter estáveis sabendo que seu código não será
quebrado. Estabilidade sem estagnação.</p>

A maioria dos usuários do Rust usa o estável na maioria das vezes. Você pode querer usar o estável na mioria das vezes, mas usará o <em>Nightly</em> em um projeto específico por se preocupar com um recurso de ponta. Para fazer isso, você pode usar <code>rustup override</code> no diretório desse projeto para definir que o <em>toolchain</em> do <em>Nightly</em> deve ser usado quando o <code>rustup</code> for usado nesse diretório.</div>

<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/team.html">no site do Rust</a>,
que inclui equipes para cada área do projeto: design de linguagem, implementação
do compilador, infraestrutura, documentação e muito mais. A equipe apropriada
lê a proposta e os comentários, escreve alguns comentários próprios e,
eventualmente, há um consenso para aceitar ou rejeitar o recurso.</p>

chega à <em>branch</em> <code>master</code> atrás de um sinalizador de recurso, conforme

<em>Nightly</em> puderem experimentar o novo recurso, os membros da equipe discutirão o
recurso, como ele funciona no <em>Nightly</em> e decidirão se ele deve se tornar parte
do Rust estável ou não. Se a decisão for sim, o portão do recurso será removido
e o recurso agora será considerado estável! Ele entra no próximo trem para uma
nova versão estável do Rust.</p>

        fpm-ui.dark-mode behaviour:

        fpm-ui.dark-mode is a boolean, default false, it tells the UI to show
        the UI in dark or light mode. Themes should use this variable to decide
        which mode to show in UI.

        fpm-ui.dark-mode-follow-system, boolean, default true, keeps track if
        we are reading the value of `dark-mode` from system preference, or user
        has overridden the system preference.

        These two variables must not be set by ftd code directly, but they must
        use `$event-click$: message-host enable-dark-mode`, to ignore system
        preference and use dark mode. `$event-click$: message-host
        disable-dark-mode` to ignore system preference and use light mode and
        `$event-click$: message-host follow-system-dark-mode` to ignore user
        preference and start following system preference.

        we use a cookie: `fpm-dark-mode` to store the preference. The cookie can
        have three values:

           cookie missing /          user wants us to honour system preference
               system-light          and currently its light.

           system-dark               follow system and currently its dark.

           light:                    user prefers light

           dark:                     user prefers light

        We use cookie instead of localstorage so in future `fpm-repo` can see
        users preferences up front and renders the HTML on service wide
        following user's preference.
