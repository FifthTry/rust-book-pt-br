store elements of only one type. We created a workaround in Listing 8-10 where
we defined a <code>SpreadsheetCell</code> enum that had variants to hold integers, floats,
and text. This meant we could store different types of data in each cell and
still have a vector that represented a row of cells. This is a perfectly good
solution when our interchangeable items are a fixed set of types that we know
when our code is compiled.</p>

types that are valid in a particular situation. To show how we might achieve
this, we’ll create an example graphical user interface (GUI) tool that iterates
through a list of items, calling a <code>draw</code> method on each one to draw it to the
screen—a common technique for GUI tools. We’ll create a library crate called
<code>gui</code> that contains the structure of a GUI library. This crate might include
some types for people to use, such as <code>Button</code> or <code>TextField</code>. In addition,
<code>gui</code> users will want to create their own types that can be drawn: for
instance, one programmer might add an <code>Image</code> and another might add a
<code>SelectBox</code>.</p>

how the pieces would fit together. At the time of writing the library, we can’t
know and define all the types other programmers might want to create. But we do
know that <code>gui</code> needs to keep track of many values of different types, and it
needs to call a <code>draw</code> method on each of these differently typed values. It
doesn’t need to know exactly what will happen when we call the <code>draw</code> method,
just that the value will have that method available for us to call.</p>

<code>Component</code> that has a method named <code>draw</code> on it. The other classes, such as
<code>Button</code>, <code>Image</code>, and <code>SelectBox</code>, would inherit from <code>Component</code> and thus
inherit the <code>draw</code> method. They could each override the <code>draw</code> method to define
their custom behavior, but the framework could treat all of the types as if
they were <code>Component</code> instances and call <code>draw</code> on them. But because Rust
doesn’t have inheritance, we need another way to structure the <code>gui</code> library to
allow users to extend it with new types.</p>

<code>Draw</code> that will have one method named <code>draw</code>. Then we can define a vector that
takes a <em>trait object</em>. A trait object points to both an instance of a type
implementing our specified trait as well as a table used to look up trait
methods on that type at runtime. We create a trait object by specifying some
sort of pointer, such as a <code>&amp;</code> reference or a <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> smart pointer, then the
<code>dyn</code> keyword, and then specifying the relevant trait. (We’ll talk about the
reason trait objects must use a pointer in Chapter 19 in the section
<a href="ch19-04-advanced-types.html#dynamically-sized-types-and-the-sized-trait">“Dynamically Sized Types and the <code>Sized</code> Trait.”</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->) We can use trait objects in place of a generic or concrete type.
Wherever we use a trait object, Rust’s type system will ensure at compile time
that any value used in that context will implement the trait object’s trait.
Consequently, we don’t need to know all the possible types at compile time.</p>

“objects” to distinguish them from other languages’ objects. In a struct or
enum, the data in the struct fields and the behavior in <code>impl</code> blocks are
separated, whereas in other languages, the data and behavior combined into one
concept is often labeled an object. However, trait objects <em>are</em> more like
objects in other languages in the sense that they combine data and behavior.
But trait objects differ from traditional objects in that we can’t add data to
a trait object. Trait objects aren’t as generally useful as objects in other
languages: their specific purpose is to allow abstraction across common
behavior.</p>

<div data-ext-id="main-container-external:0.inner-external:0,0,0.inner-external:0,0,0,1,1:main" data-id="0,0,0,1,1,1,12:main-container-external:0.inner-external:0,0,0.inner-external:0,0,0,1,1:main" style="border-radius: 0px; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(10,26,31,1); font-family: apple-system; font-size: 15px; font-weight: 400; line-height: 24px; padding-bottom: 8px; text-align: left; white-space: initial" class="ft_md">This concept—of being concerned only with the messages a value responds to rather than the value’s concrete type—is similar to the concept of <em>duck typing</em> in dynamically typed languages: if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck! In the implementation of <code>run</code> on <code>Screen</code> in Listing 17-5, <code>run</code> doesn’t need to know what the concrete type of each component is. It doesn’t check whether a component is an instance of a <code>Button</code> or a <code>SelectBox</code>, it just calls the <code>draw</code> method on the component. By specifying <code>Box&lt;dyn Draw&gt;</code> as the type of the values in the <code>components</code> vector, we’ve defined <code>Screen</code> to need values that we can call the <code>draw</code> method on.</div>

Rust won’t compile our code if the values don’t implement the traits that the trait objects need.</div>

Generics”</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> section in
Chapter 10 our discussion on the monomorphization process performed by the
compiler when we use trait bounds on generics: the compiler generates
nongeneric implementations of functions and methods for each concrete type
that we use in place of a generic type parameter. The code that results from
monomorphization is doing <em>static dispatch</em>, which is when the compiler knows
what method you’re calling at compile time. This is opposed to <em>dynamic
dispatch</em>, which is when the compiler can’t tell at compile time which method
you’re calling. In dynamic dispatch cases, the compiler emits code that at
runtime will figure out which method to call.</p>

The compiler doesn’t
know all the types that might be used with the code that is using trait
objects, so it doesn’t know which method implemented on which type to call.
Instead, at runtime, Rust uses the pointers inside the trait object to know
which method to call. There is a runtime cost when this lookup happens that
doesn’t occur with static dispatch. Dynamic dispatch also prevents the compiler
from choosing to inline a method’s code, which in turn prevents some
optimizations. However, we did get extra flexibility in the code that we wrote
in Listing 17-5 and were able to support in Listing 17-9, so it’s a trade-off
to consider.</p>

armazenar elementos do mesmo tipo. Criamos uma solução alternativa na Listagem 8-10, onde
definimos um enum chamado <code>SpreadsheetCell</code> que tinha variantes para conter inteiros, flutuantes
e texto. Isso significa que poderiamos armazenar diferentes tipos de dados em cada célula e
ainda ter um vetor que representasse uma linha de células. Isso é uma solução ótima
quando nossos itens intercambiáveis são um conjunto fixo de tipos que sabemos
quando nosso código é compilado.</p>

tipos que são válidos em uma situação específica. Para mostrar como podemos alcançar
isso, criaremos um exemplo de ferramenta de interface gráfica (GUI) que interage
através de uma lista de itens, chamando um método <code>desenhar</code> em cada um para desenhá-lo
na tela - uma técnica comum para ferramentas GUI. Criaremos uma crate chamada
<code>gui</code> que contém a estrutura da biblioteca GUI. Essa crate pode incluir
alguns tipos para as pessoas usarem, como um <code>Button</code> ou <code>TextField</code>. Além disso,
usuários de <code>gui</code>vão querer criar seus próprios tipos que podem ser desenhados: por
exemplo, um programados pode adicionar uma <code>Image</code> e outro pode adicionar um
<code>SelectBox</code>.</p>

como as peças se encaixariam. No momento de escrever a biblioteca, não podemos
saber e definir todos os tipos que outros programadores podem querer criar. Mas sabemos
que <code>gui</code> precisa manter o controle de diferentes valores de diferentes tipos e ele
precisa chamar o método <code>desenhar</code> em cada um desses diferentes tipos de valores. Não
é necessário saber exatamente o que acontecerá quando chamarmos o método <code>desenhar</code>,
apenas que o valor tera este método disponível para executarmos.</p>

<code>Component</code> que possui um método chamado <code>desenhar</code>. As outras classes, como as
<code>Button</code>, <code>Image</code> e <code>SelectBox</code>, herdam de <code>Component</code> e, assim,
herdam o método <code>desenhar</code>. Cada uma pode sobrescrever o método <code>desenhar</code> para definir
seu comportamento próprio, mas o framework poderia tratar todos esses tipos se
eles fossem instâncias de <code>Component</code> e chamar <code>desenhar</code> neles. Mas como Rust
não tem herança, precisamos de outra maneira para estruturar a biblioteca <code>gui</code> para
perminir que os usuários o estendam com novos tipos.</p>

especificando um trait relevante (falaremos sobre o motimo pelo qual os objetos trait
devem ser usados no Capítulo 19, na seção “Tipos e tamanhos dimensionados dinamicamente”).
Podemos usar objetos trait no lugar de um tipo genérico ou concreto. Onde quer que usemos
um objeto trait, o sistema de tipos do Rust irá garantir em tempo de compilação que qualquer
valor usado nesse contexto implementará o trait de um objeto trait.
Consequentemente, não precisamos saber todos os possíveis tipos em tempo de compilação.</p>

“objetos” para distingui-los dos objetos de outras linguagens. Em uma estrutura ou
enum, o dado nos campos e o comportamento no bloco <code>impl</code> são
separados, enquanto em outras linguagens o dado e o comportamento são combinados em um
conceito muitas vezes chamado de objeto. No entanto, objetos trait <em>são</em> mais como
objetos em outras linguagens no sentido de combinar dados e comportamento.
Mas objetos trait diferem de objetos tradicionais, pois não podemos adicionar dados
a um objeto trait. Objetos trait geralmente não são proveitosas como um objeto de outras
linguagens: sua finalidade é simplemente possibilitar a abstração entre
comportamento comum.</p>

em vez do tipo concreto de valores - é similar ao conceito <em>duck typing</em>
em linguagens dinâmicamente tipadas: se anda como um pato e é como um pato,
então deve ser um pato! Na implementação do <code>executar</code> na <code>Janela</code> na Listagem
17-5, <code>executar</code> não precisa saber qual é o tipo concreto que cada componente é.
Ele não verifica se um componente é uma instância de <code>Button</code> ou
um <code>SelectBox</code>, apenas chama o método <code>desenhar</code> do componente. Especificando
<code>Box&lt;Draw&gt;</code> como o tipo dos valores do vetor <code>componentes</code>, definimos
<code>Janela</code> por precisarmos de valores nos quais podemos chamar o método <code>desenhar</code>.</p>

semelhante ao código usando duck typing é que nunca precisamos verificar se um valor
implementa umm método em particular no tempo de execução ou se preocupar com erros se
um valor não implementa um método, mas nós o chamamos mesmo assim. Rust não irá compilar nosso
código se os valores não implementarem os traits que o objeto trait precisa.</p>

discussão sobre o processo de monomorfização realizado pelo compilador quando
usamos trait bounds em genéricos: o compilador gera implementações não genéricas
de funções e métodos para cada tipo concreto que usamos no lugar
de um parâmetro de tipo genérico. O código que resulta da monomorfização
está fazendo <em>despacho estático</em>, que é quando o compilador sabe qual método você está
chamando em tempo de compilação. Isso é oposto ao <em>despacho dinâmico</em>, que é quando
o compilador não sabe dizer que método você está chamando em tempo de compilação. Nos casos
de despacho dinâmico, o compilador emite códigos que, em tempo de execução, descobrirá qual método
chamar.</p>

O compilador não
sabe todos os tipos que podem ser usados com código que está usando os objetos trait,
por isso não sabe qual método implementado em que tipo chamar.
Em vez disso, em tempo de execução, Rust usa os ponteiros dentro de objeto trait para saber
que método, específico, deve chamar. Há um custo de tempo de execução quando essa pesquisa ocorre,
que não ocorre com despacho estático. Dispacho dinâmico também impede que o
compilador escolha inline o código de um método, o que, por vezes, impede
algumas otimizações. No entanto, conseguimos uma maior flexibilidade no código que escrevemos
na Listagem 17-5 e foram capazes de suportar na Listagem 17-9, é uma desvantagem
a se considerar.</p>

método. Os objetos trait devem ser seguros, porque depois de usar um objeto trait,
o Rust não conhece mais o tipo concreto que está implementando aquele trait.
Se um método trait renorna o tipo concreto <code>Self</code>, mas um objeto trait esquece
o tipo exato que `Self é, não há como o método usar o tipo concreto
original. O mesmo é verdade para parâmetros de tipo genérico que  são preenchidos com
um parâmetro de tipo concreto, quando o trait é usado: os tipos concretos fazem
parte do tipo que implementa o trait. Quando o tipo é esquecido através
do uso de um objeto trait, não há como saber  que tipo preenchem os parâmetros de
tipo genérico.</p>

        fpm-ui.dark-mode behaviour:

        fpm-ui.dark-mode is a boolean, default false, it tells the UI to show
        the UI in dark or light mode. Themes should use this variable to decide
        which mode to show in UI.

        fpm-ui.dark-mode-follow-system, boolean, default true, keeps track if
        we are reading the value of `dark-mode` from system preference, or user
        has overridden the system preference.

        These two variables must not be set by ftd code directly, but they must
        use `$event-click$: message-host enable-dark-mode`, to ignore system
        preference and use dark mode. `$event-click$: message-host
        disable-dark-mode` to ignore system preference and use light mode and
        `$event-click$: message-host follow-system-dark-mode` to ignore user
        preference and start following system preference.

        we use a cookie: `fpm-dark-mode` to store the preference. The cookie can
        have three values:

           cookie missing /          user wants us to honour system preference
               system-light          and currently its light.

           system-dark               follow system and currently its dark.

           light:                    user prefers light

           dark:                     user prefers light

        We use cookie instead of localstorage so in future `fpm-repo` can see
        users preferences up front and renders the HTML on service wide
        following user's preference.
