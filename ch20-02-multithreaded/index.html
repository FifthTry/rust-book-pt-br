We’ll also give each worker an `id` so we can distinguish between\\nthe different workers in the pool when logging or debugging.\\n\\nLet’s make the following changes to what happens when we create a `ThreadPool`.\\nWe’ll implement the code that sends the closure to the thread after we have\\n`Worker` set up in this way:\\n\\n1. Define a `Worker` struct that holds an `id` and a `JoinHandle\u003C()\u003E`.\\n2. Change `ThreadPool` to hold a vector of `Worker` instances.\\n3. Define a `Worker::new` function that takes an `id` number and returns a\\n   `Worker` instance that holds the `id` and a thread spawned with an empty\\n   closure.\\n4. In `ThreadPool::new`, use the `for` loop counter to generate an `id`, create\\n   a new `Worker` with that `id`, and store the worker in the vector.\\n\\nIf you’re up for a challenge, try implementing these changes on your own before\\nlooking at the code in Listing 20-15.\\n\\nReady?

handle a task. When the program receives a new task, it assigns one of the
threads in the pool to the task, and that thread will process the task. The
remaining threads in the pool are available to handle any other tasks that come
in while the first thread is processing. When the first thread is done
processing its task, it’s returned to the pool of idle threads, ready to handle
a new task. A thread pool allows you to process connections concurrently,

and then ask the queue for another request. With this design, we can process
<code>N</code> requests concurrently, where <code>N</code> is the number of threads. If each thread

server. Other options you might explore are the fork/join model and the
single-threaded async I/O model. If you’re interested in this topic, you can
read more about other solutions and try to implement them in Rust; with a
low-level language like Rust, all of these options are possible.</p>

pool should look like. When you’re trying to design code, writing the client
interface first can help guide your design. Write the API of the code so it’s
structured in the way you want to call it; then implement the functionality
within that structure rather than implementing the functionality and then
designing the public API.</p>

we’ll use compiler-driven development here. We’ll write the code that calls the
functions we want, and then we’ll look at errors from the compiler to determine
what we should change next to get the code to work.</p>

This is probably what we want as well, because we’ll eventually pass the argument we get in <code>execute</code> to <code>spawn</code>. We can be further confident that <code>FnOnce</code> is the trait we want to use because the thread for running a request will only execute that request’s closure one time, which matches the <code>Once</code> in <code>FnOnce</code>.</div>

parameter, because a pool with a negative number of threads makes no sense.
However, a pool with zero threads also makes no sense, yet zero is a perfectly
valid <code>usize</code>. We’ll add code to check that <code>size</code> is greater than zero before
we return a <code>ThreadPool</code> instance and have the program panic if it receives a
zero by using the <code>assert!</code> macro, as shown in Listing 20-13.</p>

threads. Here, we’ll look at how we actually create threads. The standard
library provides <code>thread::spawn</code> as a way to create threads, and
<code>thread::spawn</code> expects to get some code the thread should run as soon as the
thread is created. However, in our case, we want to create the threads and have
them <em>wait</em> for code that we’ll send later. The standard library’s
implementation of threads doesn’t include any way to do that; we have to
implement it manually.</p>

<code>ThreadPool</code> and the threads that will manage this new behavior. We’ll call
this data structure <code>Worker</code>, which is a common term in pooling
implementations. Think of people working in the kitchen at a restaurant: the
workers wait until orders come in from customers, and then they’re responsible
for taking those orders and filling them.</p>

take a closure of code to run and send it to the already running thread for
execution. We’ll also give each worker an <code>id</code> so we can distinguish between
the different workers in the pool when logging or debugging.</p>

The reason is somewhat subtle: the <code>Mutex</code> struct has no public <code>unlock</code> method because the ownership of the lock is based on the lifetime of the <code>MutexGuard&lt;T&gt;</code> within the <code>LockResult&lt;MutexGuard&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> that the <code>lock</code> method returns. At compile time, the borrow checker can then enforce the rule that a resource guarded by a <code>Mutex</code> cannot be accessed unless we hold the lock. But this implementation can also result in the lock being held longer than intended if we don’t think carefully about the lifetime of the <code>MutexGuard&lt;T&gt;</code>.</div>

However, <code>while let</code> (and <code>if let</code> and <code>match</code>) does not drop temporary values until the end of the associated block. In Listing 20-21, the lock remains held for the duration of the call to <code>job()</code>, meaning other workers cannot receive jobs.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><style>

        fpm-ui.dark-mode behaviour:

        fpm-ui.dark-mode is a boolean, default false, it tells the UI to show
        the UI in dark or light mode. Themes should use this variable to decide
        which mode to show in UI.

        fpm-ui.dark-mode-follow-system, boolean, default true, keeps track if
        we are reading the value of `dark-mode` from system preference, or user
        has overridden the system preference.

        These two variables must not be set by ftd code directly, but they must
        use `$event-click$: message-host enable-dark-mode`, to ignore system
        preference and use dark mode. `$event-click$: message-host
        disable-dark-mode` to ignore system preference and use light mode and
        `$event-click$: message-host follow-system-dark-mode` to ignore user
        preference and start following system preference.

        we use a cookie: `fpm-dark-mode` to store the preference. The cookie can
        have three values:

           cookie missing /          user wants us to honour system preference
               system-light          and currently its light.

           system-dark               follow system and currently its dark.

           light:                    user prefers light

           dark:                     user prefers light

        We use cookie instead of localstorage so in future `fpm-repo` can see
        users preferences up front and renders the HTML on service wide
        following user's preference.
