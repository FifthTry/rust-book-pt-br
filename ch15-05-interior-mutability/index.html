data even when there are immutable references to that data; normally, this
action is disallowed by the borrowing rules. To mutate data, the pattern uses
<code>unsafe</code> code inside a data structure to bend Rust’s usual rules that govern
mutation and borrowing. We haven’t yet covered unsafe code; we will in Chapter
19. We can use types that use the interior mutability pattern when we can
ensure that the borrowing rules will be followed at runtime, even though the
compiler can’t guarantee that. The <code>unsafe</code> code involved is then wrapped in a
safe API, and the outer type is still immutable.</p>

With references, if you break these rules, you’ll get a compiler error. With
<code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>, if you break these rules, your program will panic and exit.</p>

will be caught sooner in the development process, and there is no impact on
runtime performance because all the analysis is completed beforehand. For those
reasons, checking the borrowing rules at compile time is the best choice in the
majority of cases, which is why this is Rust’s default.</p>

certain memory-safe scenarios are then allowed, whereas they are disallowed by
the compile-time checks. Static analysis, like the Rust compiler, is inherently
conservative. Some properties of code are impossible to detect by analyzing the
code: the most famous example is the Halting Problem, which is beyond the scope
of this book but is an interesting topic to research.</p>

code complies with the ownership rules, it might reject a correct program; in
this way, it’s conservative. If Rust accepted an incorrect program, users
wouldn’t be able to trust in the guarantees Rust makes. However, if Rust
rejects a correct program, the programmer will be inconvenienced, but nothing
catastrophic can occur. The <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> type is useful when you’re sure your
code follows the borrowing rules but the compiler is unable to understand and
guarantee that.</p>

that use our library will be expected to provide the mechanism for sending the

email, send a text message, or something else. The library doesn’t need to know
that detail. All it needs is something that implements a trait we’ll provide
called <code>Messenger</code>. Listing 15-20 shows the library code:</p>

This trait is the interface our mock object needs to implement so that the mock can be used in the same way a real object is. The other important part is that we want to test the behavior of the <code>set_value</code> method on the <code>LimitTracker</code>. We can change what we pass in for the <code>value</code> parameter, but <code>set_value</code> doesn’t return anything for us to make assertions on. We want to be able to say that if we create a <code>LimitTracker</code> with something that implements the <code>Messenger</code> trait and a particular value for <code>max</code>, when we pass different numbers for <code>value</code>, the messenger is told to send the appropriate messages.</div>

We also define an associated function <code>new</code> to make it convenient to create new <code>MockMessenger</code> values that start with an empty list of messages. We then implement the <code>Messenger</code> trait for <code>MockMessenger</code> so we can give a <code>MockMessenger</code> to a <code>LimitTracker</code>. In the definition of the <code>send</code> method, we take the message passed in as a parameter and store it in the <code>MockMessenger</code> list of <code>sent_messages</code>.</div>

First, we create a new <code>MockMessenger</code>, which will start with an empty list of messages. Then we create a new <code>LimitTracker</code> and give it a reference to the new <code>MockMessenger</code> and a <code>max</code> value of 100. We call the <code>set_value</code> method on the <code>LimitTracker</code> with a value of 80, which is more than 75 percent of 100. Then we assert that the list of messages that the <code>MockMessenger</code> is keeping track of should now have one message in it.</div>

increases its count of how many immutable borrows are active. When a <code>Ref&lt;T&gt;</code>
value goes out of scope, the count of immutable borrows goes down by one. Just
like the compile-time borrowing rules, <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> lets us have many immutable
borrows or one mutable borrow at any point in time.</p>

would with references, the implementation of <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> will panic at
runtime. Listing 15-23 shows a modification of the implementation of <code>send</code> in
Listing 15-22. We’re deliberately trying to create two mutable borrows active
for the same scope to illustrate that <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> prevents us from doing this
at runtime.</p>

Also, your code would incur a small runtime performance penalty as a result of keeping track of the borrows at runtime rather than compile time. However, using <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> makes it possible to write a mock object that can modify itself to keep track of the messages it has seen while you’re using it in a context where only immutable values are allowed.

Recall that
<code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> lets you have multiple owners of some data, but it only gives immutable
access to that data. If you have an <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> that holds a <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>, you can
get a value that can have multiple owners <em>and</em> that you can mutate!</p>

<code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> to allow multiple lists to share ownership of another list. Because
<code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> holds only immutable values, we can’t change any of the values in the
list once we’ve created them. Let’s add in <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> to gain the ability to
change the values in the lists. Listing 15-24 shows that by using a
<code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> in the <code>Cons</code> definition, we can modify the value stored in all
the lists:</p>

By using <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>, we have an outwardly immutable <code>List</code> value. But we can use the methods on <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> that provide access to its interior mutability so we can modify our data when we need to. The runtime checks of the borrowing rules protect us from data races, and it’s sometimes worth trading a bit of speed for this flexibility in our data structures.</div>

There’s also <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code>, which offers interior mutability that’s safe to use across threads; we’ll discuss its use in Chapter 16. Check out the standard library docs for more details on the differences between these types.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><style>

lhe permite modificar um dado mesmo quando há referências imutáveis a ele:
normalmente, esta ação é proibida pelas regras de empréstimo. Para fazer isso, a
pattern usa código <code>unsafe</code> (<em>inseguro</em>) dentro de uma estrutura de dados para
dobrar as regras normais do Rust que governam mutação e empréstimo. Nós ainda
não cobrimos código unsafe; faremos isso no Capítulo 19. Podemos usar tipos que
usam a pattern de mutabilidade interior quando podemos garantir que as regras de
empréstimo serão seguidas em tempo de execução, ainda que o compilador não o
possa garantir. O código <code>unsafe</code> envolvido é então embrulhado em uma API safe,
e o tipo exterior permanece imutável.</p>

erros são pegos mais cedo no processo de desenvolvimento, e não há nenhum custo

opção na maioria dos casos, e por isso este é o padrão do Rust.</p>

alternativamente, é que certos cenários <em>memory-safe</em> (<em>seguros em termos de

tempo de compilação. A análise estática, como a do compilador Rust, é
inerentemente conservadora. Algumas propriedades do programa são impossíveis de
detectar analisando o código: o exemplo mais famoso é o Problema da Parada, que
está além do escopo deste livro mas é um tópico interessante para pesquisa.</p>

assegurar que o código obedece às regras de posse, ele pode rejeitar um programa
correto; neste sentido, ele é conservador. Se o Rust aceitasse um programa
incorreto, os usuários não poderiam confiar nas garantias que ele faz. Se, por
outro lado, o Rust rejeita um programa correto, o programador terá alguma
inconveniência, mas nada catastrófico pode acontecer. O tipo <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> é útil
quando você tem certeza que seu código segue as regras de empréstimo, mas o

Esta é a interface que nosso objeto simulado precisa ter. A outra parte importante é que queremos testar o comportamento do método <code>set_valor</code> no <code>AvisaLimite</code>. Podemos mudar o que passamos para o parâmetro <code>valor</code>, mas o <code>set_valor</code> não retorna nada sobre o qual possamos fazer asserções. Queremos poder dizer que se criarmos um <code>AvisaLimite</code> com algo que implemente a trait <code>Mensageiro</code> e um valor específico de <code>max</code>, quando passarmos diferentes números para o <code>valor</code>, o mensageiro receberá o comando para enviar as mensagens apropriadas.</div>

Também definimos uma função associada <code>new</code> para facilitar a criação de novos valores <code>MensageiroSimulado</code> que começam com uma lista vazia de mensagens. Então implementamos a trait <code>Mensageiro</code> para o <code>MensageiroSimulado</code> para que possamos passar um <code>MensageiroSimulado</code> a um <code>AvisaLimite</code>. Na definição do método <code>enviar</code>, nós pegamos a mensagem passada como parâmetro e a armazenamos na lista <code>mensagens_enviadas</code> do <code>MensageiroSimulado</code>.</div>

Lembre-se
de que o <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> nos permite ter múltiplos possuidores de algum dado, mas ele só
nos permite acesso imutável a esse dado. Se temos um <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> que contém um
<code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>, podemos ter um valor que pode ter múltiplos possuidores <em>e</em> que
podemos modificar!</p>

nos permitir que múltiplas listas compartilhassem posse de outra lista. Como o
<code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> guarda apenas valores imutáveis, nós não podemos modificar nenhum dos
valores na lista uma vez que os criamos. Vamos adicionar o <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> para
ganhar a habilidade de mudar os valores nas listas. A Listagem 15-24 mostra que,
usando um <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> na definição do <code>Cons</code>, podemos modificar o valor
armazenado em todas as listas:</p>

Tem também o <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code>, que oferece mutabilidade interior que é segura de usar entre threads; vamos discutir seu uso no Capítulo 16. Confira a documentação da biblioteca padrão para mais detalhes sobre as diferenças entre estes tipos.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><style>

    /*
        fpm-ui.dark-mode behaviour:

        fpm-ui.dark-mode is a boolean, default false, it tells the UI to show
        the UI in dark or light mode. Themes should use this variable to decide
        which mode to show in UI.

        fpm-ui.dark-mode-follow-system, boolean, default true, keeps track if
        we are reading the value of `dark-mode` from system preference, or user
        has overridden the system preference.

        These two variables must not be set by ftd code directly, but they must
        use `$event-click$: message-host enable-dark-mode`, to ignore system
        preference and use dark mode. `$event-click$: message-host
        disable-dark-mode` to ignore system preference and use light mode and
        `$event-click$: message-host follow-system-dark-mode` to ignore user
        preference and start following system preference.

        we use a cookie: `fpm-dark-mode` to store the preference. The cookie can
        have three values:

           cookie missing /          user wants us to honour system preference
               system-light          and currently its light.

           system-dark               follow system and currently its dark.

           light:                    user prefers light

           dark:                     user prefers light

        We use cookie instead of localstorage so in future `fpm-repo` can see
        users preferences up front and renders the HTML on service wide
        following user's preference.
